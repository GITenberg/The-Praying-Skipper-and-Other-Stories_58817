<p>"But I'm not going to stand for
this sort of thing," angrily protested
young Valentine as he
shoved the letter at Port Captain Graham
of the Palmetto Line. "The old man may
be as good a sailor as you say he is, but it's
high time we set him ashore on a half-pay
pension. Why, he's making our service
ridiculous. Read it out to Mr. Holmes."</p>

<p>The Port Captain fidgeted and awkwardly
wiped his glasses, for the task was
unwelcome:</p>


<p class="p2 i2"><span class="smcap">Dear Valentine</span>: Congratulations on
your decision to mix up in the business of
the old company. It seems a hefty responsibility
for so young a man, but blood
will tell. By the way, here is something
for you to investigate while the new broom
is sweeping the cobwebs away. I went
South on your <i>Suwannee</i> a month ago,
and have the honor to inform you that her
captain is a venerable nuisance, and loose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
in his top story. He is a religious crank,
clean dippy on it, held prayer-meetings
until half the passengers were driven on
deck, and had a lot of hysterical women
flocking around him for two different
services on Sunday. The <i>Suwannee</i> is a
gospel ark in command of a praying skipper,
and if only the sanctified are going
to enjoy traveling in her, you will lose a
lot of business. I reckon it's time the line
had an overhauling, so good luck to you.</p>

<p class="i7">Yours as ever,</p>

<p class="right smcap">Jim.</p>

<p class="p2">Young Mr. Valentine explained to the
surprised officials:</p>

<p>"The signer is an old college friend of
mine, man of a great deal of influence
here in New York, and he gives the line
and its biggest, newest ship this kind of
a black eye. And I have heard other
rumors to the same effect. Now I want
an explanation from both you gentlemen.
You know all about Captain Jesse Kendrick
of the <i>Suwannee</i>, and it's your business
to report such idiotic performances.
If you have been shielding a dottering old
ass, who is unfit to go to sea any longer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the sooner the thing is sifted to the bottom
the better."</p>

<p>Port Captain Graham flushed and
twisted his white mustache with a fist
like an oaken billet. He swallowed hard
as if trying to keep his rising steam under
control, and replied with a catch in his
deep voice:</p>

<p>"Mr. Valentine, I've been with the Palmetto
Line going on thirty years, from
the time when your father bought the first
old side-wheeler that flew the house flag.
Jesse Kendrick was third under me in my
first command and I know him inside out.
A finer sailor and a better man never
rounded Hatteras. Are you going to
blackguard the ranking skipper afloat in
your service because of a flimsy complaint
like that, without calling the old man up
to the office? Doesn't he get a hearing?
Why, you've just now waltzed into this
company like a boy with a lot of toy
steamboats to play with, after loafing
abroad in a muck of luxury ever since you
left your college. You've never even
clapped eyes on Captain Kendrick."</p>

<p>Mr. Holmes, the General Manager,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
was speaking before Mr. Valentine could
make heated reply. He was largely office
bred, and less outspoken than the rugged
Port Captain:</p>

<p>"As far as his religion goes, we know
that Captain Kendrick doesn't drink a
drop, and that he won't ship anything but
sober men. And your father had reason
to send the old man a good many letters
of commendation in his time. Shall I
'phone to the dock for Captain Kendrick?
He sails this afternoon."</p>

<p>"You'll do nothing of the kind,"
snarled Valentine. "I'll do my own investigating
this time, because you are a
bunch of three old pals, do you see?"</p>

<p>"But you're not going to censure him
right off the reel? Good God! it would
break the old man's heart," exclaimed the
Port Captain, leaning forward in a bluster
of indignation. "I'll bet the morals of
your friend, Jim What's-his-name, need
investigatin' a damn sight more than the
righteousness of Jesse Kendrick."</p>

<p>Mr. Valentine snapped back, but with
weakening assurance:</p>

<p>"If you can't be civil, Captain Graham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
there will be more than one reprimand in
this day's work. I am the owner ashore,
and I propose to be the boss at sea. I'll
think it over, and if I want any more of
your advice, I'll send for you. Good-morning."</p>

<p>He went into an inner office and closed
the door. The Port Captain glared at the
barrier, and growled as he trudged reluctantly
into the outer hall, arm in arm with
the General Manager.</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> spindle-shouldered, under-engined
young cub as the make-believe boss
of the Palmetto Line! What do you
think of it, Holmes? Dyin' must have
come hard to his dad when he took a last
squint at the heir to the business. This
one surely needs some of Jesse Kendrick's
spare prayers."</p>

<p>"The young Valentine is cock of the
walk," said the General Manager slowly.
"But the bantam was crowing to show his
authority this time. Anyhow, he said he
would think it over, and that means he'll
cool off. Don't say anything to Kendrick
about it. No use of discounting trouble
that may never come."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>But the two men had small acquaintance
with the methods of young Mr. Valentine.
Without letting go his purpose,
he had appeared to give way, because he
shrunk from pitting his will against this
masterful Port Captain, who made him
feel like a house of cards in a big wind.
It was not inconceivable that this over-bearing
old monster might lay him across
his knee and spank him in the white heat
of a dispute. When he heard the two
veterans depart, the new-fledged owner
turned to his stenographer:</p>

<p>"Please take a letter to Captain Kendrick
and mail it to catch him at New
Orleans. I don't want him storming in
here to-day."</p>

<p>The gray hair of the stenographer had
been a bonny brown when she entered the
employ of the Palmetto Line. As her
pencil chased his words down the pages
of her notebook, she glanced up with undisguised
amazement, and dared to comment
when her task was done:</p>

<p>"Please pardon me, but are you sure
you mean Captain Kendrick of the
<i>Suwannee</i>? You see, I have sailed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
him on several vacation trips. When he
leads the services on board, I think it is
because the passengers like to hear him
talk; such manly, honest talk about the
faith he lives day by day. He reminds
you of some Old Testament patriarch."</p>

<p>"Old Testament patriarchs are out of
date," said Mr. Valentine with evident irritation.
"Is there a conspiracy to boom
the stock of this senile old geezer? Religion
is all right for you women. I am
going South in my private car next week,
and by Jove, I will just come home on
the <i>Suwannee</i> and look the situation over
for myself. Mum's the word. And I
don't want any more of my friends to be
guying me about running a marine Sunday-school
with a sea-parson in charge.
That letter ought to choke him off coming
back."</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>A fortnight later the <i>Suwannee</i> was
steaming across the sapphire Gulf. Before
her bow flying-fish skittered and
splashed like flights of shrapnel bullets,
on deck sailors were stretching awnings
fore and aft, and wind-sails bellied in the
open hatches. Men in flannels and women
in trim, white freshness leaned along
the rail and watched the sparkling play
of color overside. There was the air of
a yachting cruise in these pleasant aspects
of the day's routine, yet the season was
the dead of winter, and the <i>Suwannee</i>
was hurrying as fast as twin screws could
drive her toward bitter latitudes.</p>

<p>On the bridge walked to and fro, with a
slightly limping gait, a man of an unusual
presence. Those who looked up at him
from the deck noted his uncommon height
and breadth, and the white beard that
swept almost to his waist. Nearer vision
was needed to know the seamed yet mobile
face, and the gray eye that held an
eager light as of strong emotions continu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>ally
burning. When he halted to speak
to his first officer, his voice was sweet and
vibrant:</p>

<p>"I am going below for a little while,
Mr. Parlin. Call me when you've run
down your course."</p>

<p>Captain Kendrick went into his room
just abaft the wheelhouse, and picked up
from his desk a typewritten letter that
showed marks of much handling. He
read it slowly, and his lip quivered as it
had done with each of many previous
readings. Seating himself upon the edge
of the couch, he said aloud little fragments
of the letter, taken here and there
without sequence:</p>

<p>"Astonishing behavior ... guilty
of annoyance ... serious complaints
... ridiculous religious display ...
prime of usefulness past ... evidently
ripe for retirement...."</p>

<p>The letter fell to the floor unheeded, as
there came into his eyes a look of impassioned
intensity that was focused ever so
far beyond the walls of this little sea-cabin.
He was on his knees and his head
was in his hands as he murmured:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cast me not off in the time of old age,
forsake me not when my strength faileth....
Thy way is in the sea, and Thy
path in the great waters.... I said
I will keep my mouth with a bridle while
the wicked are before me. But it is also
written that evening and morning and at
noon will I pray and cry aloud and He
shall hear my voice.... They have
prepared a net for my steps, my heart is
bowed down.... But Thou hast a
mighty arm, strong is Thy hand and high
is Thy right hand...."</p>

<p>While Captain Kendrick was voicing
his troubles and his consolations in words
wondrously framed by another strong
man long ago, the purser of the <i>Suwannee</i>
was sought out by Arthur Valentine,
whose manner held a trace of uneasiness.
He would not have confessed it, but far
back in the young ship-owner's head was
the glimmering notion that a terrier might
be snapping at a mastiff. Was this imposing
figure on the bridge the "dottering
ass" to whom he had smartly dashed off
his first official reprimand, gloating in the
chance to test the sweep of his new au<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>thority?
But this suspicion now shaped
itself only in a growing fear lest he be
discovered in such uncomfortably close
quarters with Captain Jesse Kendrick.
Mr. Valentine closed the door of the
purser's room and set that worthy officer's
teeth on edge by remarking:</p>

<p>"Fine morning. I say, you needn't
bother to make any special point of seating
me at the captain's table. Fact is, I
don't want to be bored. Just put me over
at your table, will you? And please tell
nobody who I am. I want to look around
a bit. The captain doesn't know that I'm
on board, I take it, or he would have been
showing me some troublesome attentions.
So you need say nothing to him about it.
Just see that my name is rubbed off his
copy of the passenger list."</p>

<p>The purser disentangled himself from
a staggering heap of cargo manifests, and
emphasized his reply with a wave of an
inky finger:</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Valentine, if those are
your orders, but you miss your guess if
you think our skipper is going to run after
you or any other passenger. He ain't that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
kind. But sub rosy you go and as far as
you like, till further notice."</p>

<p>Slightly ruffled, Mr. Valentine sauntered
on deck, where he fell in with
Second-Officer Peter Carr, who proved
to be contrastingly voluble and cheerful.
Before the passenger could ask certain
questions that were in his mind, Mr. Carr
flourished an arm seaward, and began:</p>

<p>"Passin' that bark yonder reminds me
of a voyage I sailed as bos'n in the old
packet <i>Guiding Star</i>, out o' Liverpool
for Sydney. We was carryin' two hundred
Irish girls as immygrants, an' soon
after we crossed the Line they mutinied
'cause we refused to give 'em curlin'
irons, an' let 'em waltz with the sailors
every night an' twice on Sunday. 'Bout
four bells of the middle watch pourin'
out o' the hatches they come like a consolidated
female explosion. I was in th'
waist, an' fust I knowed them millions of
infuriated young angels surged straight
at poor Peter Carr. Sez I to myself,
here's too much of a good thing for once,
an' with that I makes a flyin' scoot an'
scrambles aloft like a cat with a bunch o'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
firecrackers belayed to its spanker boom.
Sw-o-o-o-s-h, the rustle of them billion o'
skirts is like the sound of a nor'easter.
Wh-e-e-e-e, them shrieks of disapp'inted
rage is still ringin' in my ears. I seen the
poor old skipper poke his head out o' the
companionway, an' so help me, before he
had time to say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Carr stopped abruptly and his animated
countenance froze in horror as he
saw Captain Kendrick wave a beckoning
hand from far forward.</p>

<p>"He's got me again," muttered the
mate, as he obeyed the summons and was
seen to follow the cause of his panic into
the captain's room.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mr. Carr," said Captain
Kendrick, with a menacing note in his
voice. "You have broken your solemn
promise made to me last voyage. Those
same old gestures told me you were climbing
the shrouds of the <i>Guiding Star</i>
again. How often have I got to tell you
that the <i>Guiding Star</i> packet foundered
a dozen years before you went to sea? You
soft-shelled coaster, you wouldn't know
the equator if it flew up and hit you in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
nose. 'When you were crossing the Line'&mdash;lies,
all lies!"</p>

<p>Peter Carr rubbed his red head and
looked sheepish. "Right you are, sir. I
forgot, sir," he stammered. "But I'm improvin'.
I can feel it workin'."</p>

<p>"It isn't only your speech and conduct
that need overhauling," commented Captain
Kendrick severely, as he dug his two
fists into his beard and towered over the
contrite mate. "These things are signs
of an inward state of spiritual rottenness,
and I intend to hammer the blessed truth
into you as long as we are shipmates.
Look at me. Am I a worse sailor for
trying to be what your mother on Cape
Cod prayed you might grow into, when
she used to tuck you up in bed?"</p>

<p>Mr. Carr was as earnest as ever in his
turbulent career as he responded:</p>

<p>"I'll keep in mind what you say, sir. If
all the people that flies church colors was
like you, a &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; sight more of 'em
'ud practice what they preach. Whoa,
Bill, I didn't mean to rip out them
naughty words. I swear I didn't, sir."</p>

<p>The old man sighed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're still in the mire. But I'm not
done with you. I'll have you on your
knees yet, Peter Carr."</p>

<p>As the mate rolled forward he muttered:</p>

<p>"He's sometimes kind of wearin', but
he means well. An' he's gettin' me so
tame I'll be eatin' out of his hand before
long."</p>

<p>Arthur Valentine was hovering within
ear-shot, and he halted the solemn-faced
officer with:</p>

<p>"Sorry you couldn't finish that bully
yarn of the <i>Guiding Star</i>. Anything the
matter? How did you escape from the
two hundred angry ladies?"</p>

<p>Mr. Carr beamed with animation as he
hastened to reply: "Well, as I was sayin',
the poor old skipper of her stuck his head
on deck, an' before he could&mdash; Oh, d&mdash; Ouch,
excuse me. I bit my tongue. I
mean, well, I never did get down out of
that riggin', and that's the end of the
yarn. Can't explain. No time to talk
now."</p>

<p>Valentine was puzzled, and laid a hand
on the sleeve of the fleeing mate:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"What the dickens ails you? Why
can't you finish that yarn?"</p>

<p>Mr. Carr whipped round and shouted
with a noble impulse:</p>

<p>"I ain't goin' to lie again, so help me.
The captain's been laborin' with my poor
sin-streaked soul, and I passed the word
to steer by his sailin' chart. I've suffered
enough without bein' keel-hauled any
more about it."</p>

<p>"Beg pardon," smiled Valentine. "Now
I see the joke. The good old man and the
wandering boy. How nice of him. Perhaps
he will pray for me if I send up a
card. Is he often taken that way?"</p>

<p>"Pretty regular," grinned the mate as
he made good his retreat.</p>

<p>"Was I right? Well, rather," thought
Valentine. "It's time I took hold of
things. If we should run into a storm,
the old duffer would be on his knees praying
for good weather and let the ship go
to pot."</p>

<p>Later in the day a notice posted in the
"social hall" caught his roving eye:</p>

<p>"To-morrow (Sunday) divine service
will be held in the main saloon at ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
o'clock. As is customary in steamers of
this line when there is no clergyman
among the passengers, the captain will be
in charge of this service."</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Four bells on Sunday morning found
the saloon half filled with voyagers, most
of whom looked as if church-going was
their custom. Sunlight flooded through
the open ports and fretted the floor with
dancing patterns as the steamer rolled
lazily with the weight of the breathing
sea. A warm wind gushed under the skylights
and brought with it the thankful
twitter of a little brown land-bird blown
into the rigging over night. If ever worship
were meet at sea, a singular aptness
was in the peace and brightness of this
place.</p>

<p>A hymn was sung and the captain read
the morning service from the prayer-book.
Then he threw back his shoulders
without knowing that he did so, until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
blue uniform coat stretched very taut
across his bulky chest, and his corded hand
gripped a small Bible that lay before him.
Something in his pose told those of quick
intuition that big emotions were hard
held. They knew not why, but this hoary
pillar of a man was tugging at their sympathies
even before he began to speak, at
first frowningly, then with a gathering
light in his rugged face:</p>

<p>"From time to time I have tried to
make these shipboard services a little more
than the routine calls for. It was my way
of thinking that when the Lord has led a
man up out of the pit, and planted his
feet on the Rock, he ought not to be
ashamed of it. Perhaps I have had pride
in my redemption. But it seemed to me a
wonderful thing that a wicked, drunken
young sailor, with no mother and no
home, should be brought up with a round
turn, as by a miracle of grace; that like a
great light shining on the deep waters,
the new hope of a better, manlier life
came to him; and that he found the peace
that passeth all understanding. Since
then, some men and women have told me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
that they remembered sailing with me
long after the voyage was done.</p>

<p>"Now I can speak no more of these
things. This may be my last voyage, and
if I were to talk to you out of the fullness
of my heart it would be wrong. For the
Book says, 'servants obey your masters,'
and I am still a servant, wearing a servant's
livery, and I have been proud to
wear it for a good many years. I can't
say any more. Several passengers asked
me to give a talk in connection with the
morning's service, and I want them to
know that in disappointing them, my
wishes have been overruled. Let us all
thank God for fair weather in a closing
hymn."</p>

<p>Arthur Valentine left the saloon fairly
well pleased with himself, but inwardly
recording one objection:</p>

<p>"He's pretty well muzzled, but I wrote
him to cut out all his religious palaver in
public, and I won't stand for any more of
this nonsense of playing the martyr. That
goes."</p>

<p>While idling forward after lunch, he
met the first-officer coming off watch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Mischievous fortune thus brought together
a young man with an axe to
grind and a soured elder with a grievance.</p>

<p>"So the captain is ready to stay ashore,"
observed Valentine after a few greeting
commonplaces. "Did you hear his queer
speech this morning? I wonder what he
was driving at? A passenger can't help
being curious to know."</p>

<p>Mr. Parlin was a ripe and ruddy picture
of a mariner, passing as heartily
frank of speech except among those who
knew him well. A lurking notion that
he had seen this young man in New York
was somehow coupled in his mind with the
company's head offices, where an errand
had called him before leaving that port.
As he studied the passenger before replying,
his glance was drawn to the gun-metal
cigarette case, casually produced, whose
face bore in gold outline the initials
"A. H. V." Mr. Parlin was not dull
witted. These letters stood for the name
of the "old man's son."</p>

<p>The first-officer became inwardly alert
as he said: "Well, Captain Kendrick is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
getting old, and he hasn't been right since
he was smashed up so bad three years
ago."</p>

<p>"How smashed?" asked Valentine eagerly.</p>

<p>"Got washed into the scuppers of the
<i>Juanita</i>. They found him jammed under
a boat with his timbers busted to smithereens.
You may have noticed that he
walks with a list to port."</p>

<p>"He didn't break his head, did he?" and
Valentine tapped his forehead with a significant
finger.</p>

<p>"Well, that's not for me to say," and
Mr. Parlin hesitated, with a flutter of an
eyelid; "but he has his hobby, and he sets
all the sail it'll carry. You may have noticed
it this morning. But he was going
it very easy then."</p>

<p>"I'd have had my ship long before
this," continued Mr. Parlin, "if the old
man hadn't put a black mark on my
record in the main office. Now that he
talks of going out of the line, there's no
harm in my sayin' that if I'd flopped on
my knees and spouted psalms instead of
sticking to my duties, it would be Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Parlin by now. Excuse me. I have some
work on."</p>

<p>Valentine said to himself as he watched
the burly, bow-legged figure lumber toward
a main-deck ladder:</p>

<p>"Now, <i>there's</i> a proper sailor for you!
And this captain&mdash;pshaw, he makes me
sick."</p>

<p>At the same time Mr. Parlin was thinking:</p>

<p>"Neatly done. I put a nail in the old
cuss's coffin."</p>

<p>Three days passed before Captain
Kendrick made a social appearance on
the after deck. His old friends among
the passengers welcomed his lavish fund
of stories, some of them a trifle heavy,
but all delivered with beaming good nature,
and such thunderous sallies of
laughter as wagged the white beard until
his audience joined in from sheer sympathy.
Valentine hung on the outskirts
for a little while and then preferred to
walk the deck. He felt irritation and disgust,
partly because he thought he ought
to be holding the center of the stage, and
regretting that expediency should force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
him to travel incognito. Wouldn't these
silly folk open their eyes if they knew how
easily he, the owner, could lay this childish
old nuisance of a skipper on the shelf?
And he chafed the more because the poison
so deftly administered by the first
mate was working to confirm all his headlong
suspicions.</p>

<p>Scowling at the jolly company as he
passed them, Valentine caught a new note
of earnestness in the captain's voice and
stopped to listen:</p>

<p>"It may not be wrong after all, now
that you are all urging me, and I will cut
it short. God has been very good to me,
and in my poor way I try to bear witness.
And you may understand when I tell you
what happened in '67 when I was battering
around the fo'ksle of a deep-water
ship out of Baltimore. Never will I forget
the night when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words produced an extraordinary
effect upon Valentine. Blind anger seized
him. He could see nothing else than that
the captain was defying his written order,
the passengers abetting him, and the
whole group making a mockery of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
authoritative judgment. He brushed in
among the listeners, and shouted in a
gusty treble:</p>

<p>"This has got to stop, I tell you. What
did I write you, Captain Kendrick, about
all this religious tommy-rot? I'll show
you whose orders go on this ship."</p>

<p>The company scattered as if a bomb
had lit in the midst of it as Captain
Kendrick took two strides, whipped out
a long arm and grasped Valentine by the
shoulder:</p>

<p>"No man gives me orders on the deck
of my ship at sea. Do you want to go
below in irons? Who are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My name is A. H. Valentine, and I
threatened to kick you out of your berth
two weeks ago, and you know it,"
screamed the struggling young man.
"Turn me loose, I tell you. Pension be
hanged. Now you can go ashore and rot.
I own this ship and a dozen like her. I'll
put the first officer in command to-day,
and it's high time, too. He deserves it,
and I know why he lost his promotion."</p>

<p>"I don't care if you're the Emperor of
Chiny. Put a stopper on that tongue of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
yours, or&mdash;" Captain Kendrick checked
his hot words and looked at the agitated
young man like a pitying father. "You
don't know any better, do you? We'll
talk it all over ashore. But not at sea,
understand&mdash;not at sea."</p>

<p>Captain Kendrick walked slowly toward
his room without looking back, and
sent word for Mr. Parlin to come to him
at once. The mate breezed in with hearty
salutation, but his high color paled a little
when he looked squarely at the captain's
flinty face.</p>

<p>"Stand on your two feet like a man,
Mr. Parlin, for you're before your commander.
Have you been telling lies to a
passenger named Valentine?"</p>

<p>"Didn't know Mr. Valentine was
aboard, sir. Wouldn't know him if he
was sitting there in your chair. Are you
trying to insult me?"</p>

<p>"Could I insult a slush-bucket?" thundered
the captain. "You have been talking
to Mr. Valentine. Don't spit out the
lie that's on the tip of your tongue. Two
years ago, I found you asleep on watch.
At other times you have been slack and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
inefficient. I reported you every time.
That's why you've seen three mates go
over your head and get their ships. If
I'd had my way you'd have been disrated
or thrown on the beach. But you worked
wires ashore, you harpooned me in the
back, and you held your berth instead of
being kicked out for a better man."</p>

<p>The mate's face was purple as he stammered:</p>

<p>"I haven't said anything against you,
sir."</p>

<p>"If you're trying to work up into the
wind with Mr. Valentine, you wait until
you get ashore," growled the captain.
"This is my ship until she docks. You
can't say I ever tried to convert you to
God. He doesn't want jelly-fish. He
wants men."</p>

<p>Driven into a corner, the mate tried to
take the aggressive in a burst of defiance:</p>

<p>"I guess that what Mr. Valentine says
goes. I'll see that he hears my side of the
case before sundown."</p>

<p>Mr. Parlin had gone too far, and he
knew it before he had bitten off his empty
words. Captain Kendrick jumped to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
feet, and his beard was pushed within an
inch of Mr. Parlin's bulbous nose:</p>

<p>"You're disrated now. Mr. Carr takes
your berth until we make port. Get
for'ard, you mutinous loafer."</p>

<p>"Get nothin'!" yelled Mr. Parlin. "I'm
going aft to see the real boss."</p>

<p>Two hairy hands clamped down on his
shoulders, and he was swung clear of the
deck. Then his heavily shod toes beat an
intermittent tattoo over the sill and along
the planks, as he was hauled and shoved
toward his own room. The captain shifted
his burden until the mate was tucked under
one arm, breathless, impotent, trickling
juicy curses. He was dumped inside
and heard the heavy storm-door slam and
the click of a turning key before he could
heave himself to his feet and hammer the
barricade in useless rage until his fists
bled.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Captain Kendrick had no more time to
bother with such trifles as the outbreak of
Valentine. Before this day had darkened
the sky turned a dirty yellow, and the
weight of the wind was not enough to
account for the greasy, sluggish roll of
the sea. The barometer needle slid unwaveringly
toward the danger point, and
after some uncertain shifting, the wind
hauled to the northeast and grew steadily
colder. Stripped of all superfluous gear
on deck, the <i>Suwannee</i> was licked into
fighting trim, gaunt, streaming and
naked. The weeping drizzle that fogged
the sky line changed to sleet, and soon
after dusk came blinding snow with a
great fury of wind.</p>

<p>When the captain faced the storm on
his quivering bridge, he felt as if all
breath and warmth were instantly blown
out of him. No fleecy snowflakes these,
but hooting volleys of icy shot, incessantly
delivered. He groped along the
canvased rail in a choking fight for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
breath until he found Mr. Carr. They
gasped and flinched as they vainly tried
to peer into the whirling smother.</p>

<p>The sea rose with incredible swiftness.
Within the hour, the <i>Suwannee</i> could no
longer be held on her course. Yawing
wildly whenever a vicious onset of the sea
smashed against her quarter and toppled
on deck, the ship was brought round and
hove to, dead into it. Then the racing of
her screws shook her until it seemed as if
the engines would tear her hull apart, and
speed was slowed as much as the captain
dared.</p>

<p>Mr. Parlin was still locked in his stateroom,
and as the deep-laden <i>Suwannee</i>
wrestled with the blizzard, Captain Kendrick
argued in his mind whether the
mutinous officer should be released at a
time when all hands were sorely needed.
The third officer had not been long enough
promoted to shoulder any grave responsibility.
In such a night as this, whose
menace was hourly increasing, the vital
issue was to safeguard the ship. But the
captain's manhood rebelled against a
compromise with his deed of clean-cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
justice. And rankling in his heart was
a damnable phrase, "prime of usefulness
is past." It helped to give him the
strength of two, now that the test had
come, and he decided to fight it through
with Peter Carr.</p>

<p>Before midnight the cold was so benumbing
and deadly, without chance of
respite, that freezing fast to the rail to
which they clung was a fate that threatened
master and mate. Each begged the
other to seek a little warmth and shelter,
and their indomitable wills were dead-locked
time and again. At length the
captain put it as a most emphatic command,
and fairly hustled Peter Carr down
the steps to the steam-heated wheelhouse.
When the mate returned, hot with
coffee and protestations that the captain
take a turn below, the old man refused
with a passionate gesture of finality.</p>

<p>Although he had striven to bank the
fires of resentment, his thoughts burned
like coals that callow youth, sitting in
judgment, should have flung aside his
faith and works together like so much
trash. But never for a moment did such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
introspections relax his alert understanding
of every symptom of the laboring
tussle between ship and sea. So far she
had come unhurt. Now, once, as she
climbed wearily and hung for an instant
like a giant see-saw, Captain Kendrick
became tensely expectant as he felt
through the planking a strange jarring
break, somewhere down in her vitals.</p>

<p>Then, instead of splendidly crashing
down the long slope into the hidden wrath
of water, the <i>Suwannee</i> began to swing
broadside as if on a pivot. The wild impulse
was unchecked, even as her bow
slanted into the tumbling barrier, and
heaving far down to port, she rolled helpless
and exposed, as a bewildered boxer
drops the guard that shields his jaw from
the knock-out blow.</p>

<p>"<i>Hard over, hard over</i>," yelled the captain
down the tube to an empty wheelhouse,
for a pallid quartermaster darted
from within, and scrambled to the bridge,
shouting:</p>

<p>"She won't steer, &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; her, she
won't steer. The gear has carried away
below."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>With one look to windward, the captain
crawled to the engine-room indicator and
sent clamoring signals to reverse the port
and jam full speed ahead with the starboard
screw. But before the <i>Suwannee</i>
could feel the altered drive of her engines,
so huge a sea raced over her lurching
bow that the port side of the bridge
crumpled under the attack like a wire
bird-cage smashed with a club. Roaring
aft, the gray flood ripped a string of
boats from their lashings. It left their
fragments absurdly dangling from the
twisted davits, and poured through the
cabin skylights, whose strength collapsed
like pasteboard.</p>

<p>Peter Carr had seen the danger in time
to shout a warning as he fled to the starboard
end of the bridge. On top of him
came the captain, washed along in a tangle
of splintered oak and canvas. The mate
crawled from beneath and looked for the
quartermaster. A sodden bundle of oil-skins
was doubled around a stanchion
almost at his feet, and life was gone
from the battered features. Instinctively
glancing seaward, the mate noted that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the <i>Suwannee</i> had responded to the send
of her screws, and was veering now to
port. He signaled to ease her, and as
she headed into it again, he made a rush
and dragged the skipper clear. The
sleeted beard was matted with blood, but
the old man stirred and opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"We've got to nurse her along with the
engines," he muttered brokenly. "Thank
God for twin screws. Stand by the indicator.
Sing down for hands to clear the
wreckage, and overhaul the steering-gear.
It felt to me like the rudder went at the
pintles. But have 'em man the hand-wheel
aft."</p>

<p>He wiped the blood from his eyes, and
strove to get on his feet. One leg gave
way, and he hauled himself up by gripping
what was left of the rail.</p>

<p>"It's gone back on me again," he
groaned, "but it wasn't much of a leg at
best. Lend a hand, and do as I tell ye."</p>

<p>Peter Carr passed a lashing around the
skipper's waist, and so made him fast to
the steel pillar of the engine-room indicator.
Now began the infinitely wary
coaxing of the ship to face the storm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
now with a thrust of her port screw, again
with a kick of her starboard screw. It
was thus she must be steered, for word
came up that there was no mending the
damage this side of port. The mate was
afraid to take over the task of keeping
the ship headed into the storm, for this
was his first experience in a twin-screw
steamer, yet he was as much afraid that
the skipper might die if he left him where
he was.</p>

<p>The ship fought to wrest herself free
from this shifting grip, she seemed eager
to slay herself by swinging to take the
seas abeam, but the man whose face and
beard were dappled with blotches of crimson
held her hove to, as if his soul had pervaded
her clanking depths. When Peter
Carr implored him to have his hurts cared
for, the captain answered with such shattered
murmurings as these, for the cold
and the pain were biting into his brain:</p>

<p>"But ye shall die like men, and fall like
one of the princes.... Let not the
water-flood overflow me, neither let the
deep swallow me up.... Oh, spare
me that I may recover strength before I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
go hence and be no more.... Then
they cried unto the Lord in their trouble,
and He saved them out of their distress...."</p>

<p>Peter Carr was a much younger man,
and the violence of his exertions had so
warmed his blood that he had much
strength left in him. Now and then he
tugged at the captain's arm, shouted in
his ear, tried to lift him, and the third
officer, who had come from the task of
mending matters on deck, joined the heroic
struggle. The captain awoke to chide
them as if they were impatient boys, but
his eyes saw only the swirling curtain of
snow ahead and the great seas he must
meet in their teeth. Suddenly he tried to
stand erect, and shouted as he swayed:</p>

<p>"Vessel dead ahead."</p>

<p>With the words, he sent a signal to his
engine-room, and the <i>Suwannee</i> shouldered
the merest trifle off to port just as
a great gray mass slid past, so close that
the watchers smelled a whiff of steam.
The blackness was beginning to fade out
of the storm, day was breaking, and they
glimpsed alongside a cluster of jackies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
toiling in flooding seas at hawsers lashed
round two great turret guns. More than
ever convinced by this escape that his eyes
were needed on the bridge, Captain Kendrick
stayed steadfast in his purpose. The
two officers felt awe as they looked at
him, that he should have sensed, where
their eyes could not see, the danger they
had shaved by a hair's breadth. Sometimes
now his head fell forward, but the hand on
the indicator lever was ever nervously
alive to feel the ship and the raving seas,
and he was snatching her from death, inch
by inch and hour by hour.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>In the early hours of the storm, Arthur
Valentine was battering like a shuttle-cock
between the sides of his berth, sicker
in mind than in body, for manifold terrors
had come to prey upon him. Without
confidence in the captain of the ship, he
felt that his own cowardice was responsible
for failure to act when the issue had
been almost within his grasp. Through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the dragging hours, as the ship cried aloud
in every racking beam and rivet, or
quaked as if her rearing bows had rammed
a rock, Valentine convinced himself that
the captain would not have dared refuse
him if he had faced it out and insisted that
the first officer take command.</p>

<p>"Don't I own the steamer?" he groaned.
"Can't a man do what he pleases with his
own property? And I let myself be
bluffed out like a whipped pup. Only
a lunatic would have defied me. Of
course he's tucked away in a corner trying
to pray down a storm like this.
What did Carr tell me? What did Parlin
say?"</p>

<p>On the heels of these emotions came the
dreadful instant when the <i>Suwannee</i> took
aboard the sea that swept her bridge.
Valentine was flung out of his berth to
the floor in a bruised heap, and heard the
crash of glass and the riot of water which
tumbled solid into the saloon outside his
room. Before he could get footing his
room was awash, and floating luggage
knocked him this way and that. He
crawled outside and collided with a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>half-clad
man who was wringing his hands as
he wailed:</p>

<p>"Save yourself. We're sinking. Look
at the whole Atlantic Ocean in here."</p>

<p>"What's the matter? What's happened?"
gasped Valentine.</p>

<p>"What's happened? I heard the captain
had killed the first officer, or strung
him up, or something awful. And now
there surely is hell to pay. Why don't
somebody come to our rescue?"</p>

<p>What passed with him for duty, even
the high tide of heroic impulse in his
whole life, impelled Valentine to struggle
up the stairway to the "social hall" on
the deck above. He believed that the
risk of being washed overboard was very
great, he was almost certain the crazy
captain would knock him down or shoot
him, but he was braced ready to meet these
things. It was a desperate situation demanding
a desperate remedy. He felt
vague admiration and pity for himself,
as he made ready for the plunge on
deck. But a dripping sailor barred the
way.</p>

<p>"I'm willing to run the risk," protested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the hero. "It's my duty to save the ship.
She belongs to me."</p>

<p>"So does Cape Horn an' the Statue of
Liberty," returned the seaman soothingly.
"But you don't want to play with 'em
now. They'll keep all right. Nobody
goes on deck. Them's orders. Just sit
down an' play you're a train of cars. It's
lots of fun, an' it's safe an' dry."</p>

<p>Valentine tried to pass him and was
thrust back so violently that he fell upon
a comatose passenger stretched on a set-tee.
This victim sputtered feeble protest
and other voices were raised. Valentine
noticed now that several men and women
were huddled in this corner of the deck-house,
fled from the desolation below
stairs. One of them screamed above the
clamor of the wind:</p>

<p>"The ship is all smashed to pieces and
nobody knows what to do next."</p>

<p>"I am going to get forward somehow,
and put the first officer in command, if
he's alive," cried Valentine. "It's life or
death for all of us, and my word must go.
Doesn't this fool sailor know who I am?"</p>

<p>Alas, these shivering refugees scented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
a new alarm. The poor young man had
gone mad with fright, and they, too, tried
to soothe him, while a woman of them sobbingly
implored the sailor to take him
away before he became violent. Valentine
cursed them all, and clawed his way
down the hand-rail to the saloon to seek
some other exit. The way forward was
blocked by savage men dragging tarpaulins,
and they kicked him out of their path
when he would argue with them. He
splashed back and forth, like a rat in
a trap, falling against bulk-heads and
furniture, or pitched clear off his feet,
until, worn out, he slunk back in sullen
silence up among the little company in
the deck-house who waited for they knew
not what.</p>

<p>So much of Valentine's purpose had
been hammered out of him that nausea
resumed its sway, and he clung to a
cushion, helpless through interminable
hours. When he was able to pull himself
together and make feeble effort, it seemed
as if the pitching of the steamer were less
terrifying, and through an after-port the
daylight gleamed. He dragged himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to it, and caught a glimpse of somber sea
and sky. The blizzard had passed.</p>

<p>Then strong hands were thumping on
the outer door, and a steward tugged at
the inside fastenings. In a flurry of
spray three burden-bearers staggered into
the room, between them a great limp bulk
in oil-skins, whose face was hidden by a
sou'wester. As the seamen paused to veer
ever so gently around the corner of the
hallway, Valentine went close to the third
officer who led the way, and said with a
novel timidity in his voice:</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Valentine, owner of the line.
Can you tell me what has happened,
please?"</p>

<p>"It's the skipper&mdash;frozen up, busted
up, dyin' it looks to me, sir," was the
husky response. "He's brought her
through the blow lone-handed. I never
seen another man afloat as could ha' done
the trick he did."</p>

<p>The young man trailed after the stumbling
procession which turned into a large
stateroom aft. Before swift hands had
removed the boots and outer garments, a
physician from among the passengers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
was busy with hot water and bandages.
The Irish stewardess was weeping as
she tried to help. They paid no heed to
Valentine, who returned to the doorway
as often as he was jostled to one
side.</p>

<p>The three seamen huddled in the passage
talked softly among themselves, and
Valentine heard:</p>

<p>"I tink he give der first mate vat vas
comin' to him, eh? Und if der skipper's
room vas flooded out, den Mister Parlin
must been sloshin' round mit der door
gelocked, most drownded. Goot enough."</p>

<p>"It's sure all right if the old man done
it. An' him with two bum legs to start
with, buckin' her through last night.
Him gettin' smashed galley-west, rudder
busted&mdash;Hell's Delight! what a mess!
He looked as if he was all in when we
pried him loose from them slings that was
holdin' him up."</p>

<p>"Ask the doc if he can pull him through,
will you?"</p>

<p>Valentine tiptoed in, as the doctor whispered
with a warning gesture:</p>

<p>"I think so. His head needs a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
many stitches, and there is an ankle to
set and some ribs to mend. But he will
take a lot of killing yet. Come, men, you
must clear out of the hall. He will be
coming to presently."</p>

<p>What Valentine heard was mightily reinforced
by that which he saw with eyes
that were misty and troubled. Before
him lay such grim reality of duty done
as the shallows of his life had never
touched. Groping in a welter of new
thoughts, he made his way to the deck and
went forward as far as he dared, amazed
at sight of the havoc wrought overnight.
Perched on his wrecked bridge the figure
of Peter Carr swung against the brightening
sky. He had learned who Valentine
was, and called down:</p>

<p>"We'll work her up to Sandy Hook
without any blisterin' salvage bills, sir.
There's a few of us left."</p>

<p>"And these are the kind of men I was
going to stand on their heads," said Valentine
to himself, as he clambered up and
asked many eager questions. Nor was
Peter Carr at all backward in painting
with vivid word and gesture the story of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the night, down to a parting shaft of
crafty comment:</p>

<p>"And there's them that thinks the old
man is a softy an' ought to be knittin' tidies
in a home for derelict seafarin' men."</p>

<p>Restlessly seeking the captain's stateroom
again and again, Valentine was denied
admittance until late in the afternoon.
When the doctor let him in, the
old man opened his eyes and his weather-scarred
face lightened with a kindly gleam
of recognition. Valentine flushed and
began hurried speech:</p>

<p>"I hope you'll forget that letter....
Is there anything I can do?... If
you want to go to sea again, or if you
don't, or whatever else&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The doctor raised a silencing finger.
Valentine bent over to stroke a bandaged
hand which moved on the blanket just
enough to pat his with a little parental
caress. The doctor nudged Valentine
to withdraw, as the captain whispered
drowsily:</p>

<p>"All-l's well.... You didn't know
any better, did you?... So He
bringeth them into their desired haven."</p><hr class="chap" />

<p>"That's enough for to-night.
Turn around and go home. You
are a disgrace to Yale, all of you,
and you're the worst of a bad lot, Number
Five."</p>

<p>The Head Coach roared his convictions
through a megaphone from the bow of the
panting launch, and the coxswain caught
up the words and flung them in piping
echoes at the heads of the eight sullen
oarsmen facing him. The grind of the
slides and the tearing swash of blades
abruptly ceased as the slim shell trailed
with dying headway to the skitter of the
resting oars. Backs burned dull red by
the sun of long June days drooped in relaxation
that was not all weariness. John
Hastings, at Number Five, remembered
when to slip along the shore; heading
homeward in the twilight after pulling
four miles over the New London course,
was the keenest joy he had ever known.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Now, with the Harvard race less than a
week away, the daily toil was a nightmare
of ineffective striving. The pulsating
shell hesitated between strokes, it rolled
without visible cause, and seemed sentiently
to realize that the crew was rowing
as eight men, not as one.</p>

<p>The boat circled wide and the men
swept it listlessly toward the lights of the
Quarters at Gales Ferry. They had just
undergone the severest ordeal in all athletic
training in their race against the
stop watch, yet if the work had been
good they would have finished vibrant as
steel springs, spurting in this welcome
home stretch like the sweep of a hawk.
Squatted on the boathouse float a little
later, dousing pails of water over his
sweating shoulders, Hastings heard the
Stroke growl to Number Seven:</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you loafers
back there?"</p>

<p>"I'm not behind," retorted Seven, with
hair-trigger irritability. "The trouble is
in the middle of the boat. Hastings is too
heavy to row in form this year, and he
seems to have gone to pieces in the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
month. That's where the worst break in
the swing comes. Did you hear the Old
Man threaten to take him out of the boat
and get him a job as a farm hand?"</p>

<p>The Culprit wearily picked himself up
and dressed in a dark corner of the boathouse,
shunning conversation. After the
training-table supper, the Head Coach
and his younger staff of graduate experts,
who had flocked back to help stem the
adverse tide, summoned the crew into the
parlor of the lonely old farmhouse. The
Nestor of Yale rowing, who for twenty
years had taught Yale crews how to win,
leaned against the battered piano and
looked at the ruddy and wholesome young
faces around him. It might have been a
council about to weigh matters of life and
death, so grave was the troubled aspect of
the waiting group, so stern the set of their
leader's bulldog jaw.</p>

<p>To-night he had something of their
nervous uncertainty, and it showed in the
way his strong fingers played with the
fringe of the faded piano cover. Picking
up the well-worn log-book in which was
recorded year by year the daily work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Yale crews from January to July, he
turned the leaves until a text was found.
Then, slamming the book on the piano
with a vigor that made the aged wires
complain, he said:</p>

<p>"The work has been discouraging ever
since you came to New London, but to-day
it was so bad that it made me sick. I
never saw faster conditions on this course,
and yet you clawed your way up river
in twenty-two minutes and ten seconds.
That is nearly a quarter of a mile slower
than last year's crew. Do you know what
this means? You are strong enough; you
have had plenty of coaching, and I intend
to work the very souls out of you to-morrow.
If there is no improvement&mdash;well,
you had better jump overboard and
drown yourself after the race than to go
back to New Haven. No man's place is
safe in this crew, even if the race is only
four days off. This means you, Number
Five."</p>

<p>There were no songs around the piano,
as was the custom in happier evenings, nor
did the Head Coach pound the tinkling
yellow keys and lead the chorus of "Jolly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Boating Weather," as he had done so
many nights of so many years when the
work had been satisfactory. At nine
o'clock the Captain called out gruffly:</p>

<p>"All out for the walk, fellows."</p>

<p>The squad filed through the gate into
the darkness of the country lane for the
end of the day's routine, with John Hastings
trailing in rear of the procession. He
had become fond of this nightly ramble,
feeling on terms of intimacy with every
stone wall, low-roofed farmhouse and
fragrant orchard, and courting the smell
of the lush June country side as the rarest
of sleeping potions. But to-night he
strode with head down, turning over and
over in his mind the haunting list of his
sins as an oarsman. Always with him of
late, they had been driven home anew by
the events of recent hours. He looked up
at the quiet sea of little stars, and his self-reproach
unconsciously changed to the
form of a prayer:</p>

<p>"O Lord, help me to get my power on,
and to keep my slide under me. I never
worked half so hard, but I know I am
heavier and slower than I used to be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Help me to stay on the crew. I don't ask
it for my sake, but&mdash;but Mother's coming
to the race, and this is my third year on the
crew, and she never saw a race, and if I'm
kicked off now it will break her heart. It
means so much to her, and I am all she
has. And&mdash;and there's Cynthia Wells&mdash;she's
coming, too. Oh, it means everything
to me, everything."</p>

<p>Such a man was he in the glory of his
superbly conditioned strength, such a boy
in the narrow limits of his life's horizon,
bounded in this crisis by the Quarters,
the boathouse, the crew, and the shining
stretch of river!</p>

<p>The next morning sparkled with a cool
breeze from the Sound, and its salty tang
was a tonic after the sultry days that had
tugged at the weights of all the men, except
Hastings, until they were almost
gaunt. When the crew was boated for
the forenoon practice, the exhortations
of the Head Coach were even hopeful.
But after he had sent them on the first
stretch at full speed, even the <i>blasé</i> old
engineer of the launch could see that
things were going wrong in the same old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
way. The emotions of the Head Coach
were too large for words and with sinister
patience he made them row another spurt.
Before he could begin to speak, Hastings
knew that there was still a break in the
swing at Number Five, and the confirmation
came in almost a tone of entreaty
from the launch:</p>

<p>"You are still behind, Number Five,
while the rest of the crew is swinging better.
Try, for Heaven's sake, to get your
shoulders on it, and swing them up to the
perpendicular as if the devil were after
you. Do you want seven other men to
pull your hundred and ninety pounds of
beef and muscle like so much freight in
the boat? I have told you these things a
thousand times, and you must hang on to
them this time, or I can't risk bothering
with you any more. All ready, coxswain,
steer for that red barn across the river."</p>

<p>"Forward all. G-e-t ready. R-o-w-w!"
shrieked the coxswain.</p>

<p>Within the first thirty strokes Hastings
felt that he was rowing in no better form
than before, although never had he been
so grimly determined to row better.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Stung to the soul by the taunt of the
coach, he threw his splendid shoulders
against the twelve-foot sweep, striving
always to be a little ahead of Number
Six, whose instant of catch was signaled
by the tell-tale tightening of the
crease in the back of his neck. The Captain
called:</p>

<p>"Give her ten good ones, and look out
for the stroke. It's going up."</p>

<p>"O-n-e, T-w-o, Thr-e-e, F-o-u-r,
F-i-v-e," gasped the eight, in husky
chorus to the cadence of the catch.</p>

<p>"Slo-w down on your y-o-u-r slides,"
yelled the bobbing coxswain. "You're
be-h-i-n-d, Number Five."</p>

<p>Hastings could have throttled the coxswain
for this. He had heard it so often
that it cut him on the raw. The Head
Coach picked up the damnable refrain:</p>

<p>"You are behind, Number Five."</p>

<p>Recalling how once, to fill an idle half
hour, he had enumerated sixty-four faults
possible in rowing a single stroke, Hastings
was sure that in this spurt he was
committing all these and several as yet
unrecorded. The futility of his flurried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
effort became maddening. Where was
his strength going?</p>

<p>The verdict befell as the launch steamed
alongside, and a substitute perched on the
cabin roof jumped to the deck at the beckoning
of the Head Coach, who said, with
a ring of sincere regret:</p>

<p>"I am afraid I'll have to try a change
at Number Five, to see whether we can
patch up that break. Get in there, Matthews.
Better get out and take a rest,
Hastings."</p>

<p>The cast-off crawled aboard the launch
and went aft to the cock-pit under the
awnings, where he could be alone. Holding
himself bravely under the sympathetic
eyes of his comrades, he watched the substitute
grip the oar, still warm from his
own calloused hands. Nor did he yet
realize what had befallen him, and felt
vague relief that the struggle was done.
At dinner he was cheerful and flippant
and the other oarsmen admired his
"sand."</p>

<p>The reality began to overtake him when
he went to his room under the eaves, and
anxiously asked the Stroke:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, how did you go it with a new
Number Five?"</p>

<p>"A little better," replied his room-mate,
with evident reluctance. "The Old Man
says he is going to keep Matthews in your
seat for the race. It's a hard thing to talk
about, Jack. You know how broken up
we all feel about it, don't you? We
know you tried your level best, and your
extra weight this year made you slow, and
you couldn't help that. Heard from
your folks lately?"</p>

<p>Hastings was reminded of things he
had feared to let rush into the foreground.
He had been too preoccupied to think of
looking for mail downstairs, and was
starting for the door, when the Stroke
halted him with:</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot to tell you I brought up
a couple of letters for you. There they
are, on the bureau."</p>

<p>Hastings recognized his mother's handwriting
on one envelope, that of Cynthia
Wells on the other. He appeared to hesitate
which of them to open first, and in
this hour of trial, his choice was swayed by
an impulse as old as the world:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>The letter which he preferred was
dated on board the yacht <i>Diana</i>, off New
Haven, and he read slowly to himself:</p>


<p class="i2 p2"><span class="smcap">Dear Old Jack</span>:</p>

<p class="i2">I am so happy to be almost at the scene
of your victories, past and to come. And
to think I have never seen you row! How
foolish and inconsiderate of Father to
drag me abroad so early two seasons on
end. But I am bringing all the heaped-up
enthusiasm of three years&mdash;think of
that! I suppose you are as calm as <i>blanc
mange</i>, while I am jabbering rowing at
everybody in sight, and am getting really
awfully clever about strokes and catches
(are they so very catching?). Your classmate,
Dickie Munson, is on board, and has
been coaching me up on the technical mysteries,
and spinning many jolly yarns
about you. I hear you are to be elected
captain of next year's crew, the very
grandest honor at Yale. May I offer
congratulations in advance? I do so want
to see you, and will be one of the worshipping
admirers of your prowess! Of
course you will be busy until after the
race, and then you are to come down to the
<i>Diana</i> as soon as ever you can. Don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
forget that I will have an eye on you all
the way down the course.</p>

<p class="i7">Yours as ever,</p>
<p class="right smcap">Cynthia.</p>

<p class="p2">Hastings tucked this letter in an inside
pocket with reverent care, and without
speaking, sought next what his mother
would say:</p>


<p class="i2 p2"><span class="smcap">My Dearest Boy</span>:</p>

<p class="i2">I have decided to come North by sea,
and will sail on the <i>Mohican</i> to-morrow.
The fare is considerably less than by rail,
and as you have insisted upon paying the
expenses of my wonderful trip, I want to
save you all I can. The ship is due at
New York late in the afternoon of the
twenty-seventh, the day before the race,
and I plan to take the earliest train to
New London, to reach there that night,
if possible. I have the address of the
boarding house in which you have reserved
the nice room for me, and you will
not have to worry at all about having me
met, as, of course, you will not be able to
come down from the Quarters. It will be
hard to bear, this being so near you on that
last night, unable even to kiss you good
night and God bless you. After the race
you can come to my room, and we will go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
to New Haven on the special train with
the crew. Of course you are going to win
again, when your mother is coming all the
way from the South to see her boy fight
for old Yale. Oh, I want so much to see
my big, handsome boy, and it will be
music for me to hear the thousands cheering
him. I received the ticket for the observation
train in Car Fifteen, and I can
find it at the station, as you directed me,
so don't have me on your mind for a moment.
I pray for you each night, and
may God bring me safe to you.</p>

<p class="i7">Your loving and adoring</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Little Mother</span>.</p>

<p class="p2">"I don't see how I can let her know,"
observed Hastings with a long sigh.</p>

<p>"Which?" asked the Stroke, as he
searched his comrade's face with shrewd
kindliness.</p>

<p>"I mean Mother, of course," was the
reply, followed by a sharp prick of conscience.
"She is coming up by sea, she is
on the way now. The other letter was
from a&mdash;from a friend. She is to be here,
too."</p>

<p>"You ought to meet her in New York&mdash;your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
mother, of course. She is first in
your thoughts, I am sure," advised the
Stroke, with a perceptible shade of disbelief.
"Just let her see that you are sound
and lusty, that's what she will care most
about. She will be sorry for your sake,
not for her own."</p>

<p>Throwing himself across his cot, Hastings
looked out of the nearest window,
down the river to where the flag above the
Harvard Quarters slashed the sky like a
ribbon of flame. There were the enemy
whom he had helped to defeat, and now it
seemed an honorable thing, greatly to be
desired, even to row on a beaten crew.
The tousled head went to the pillow, and
he could no longer help pouring out his
heart to his friend:</p>

<p>"Nothing can make it any worse than
it is. I have worked every summer so far,
and I was going to have a real vacation
this year, the first since I have been in college.
Now I can't bear to think of any
good times, with disgrace hanging over
me. I am going to apply for my summer
job again, but I've been working in the
office of a Yale man, and I am afraid he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
won't want to have a slob around him who
was kicked off the crew four days before
the race, will he? Of course he won't.
The last month has been simply hell.
Mother has been living in the thought of
this trip just to see me row against Harvard,
and&mdash;and there is a girl&mdash;well, I am
a big, whining, useless baby, that's all."</p>

<p>The Stroke was an older man by five
years, who had known a man's stress and
sorrows before his college days began.
Had he been a man of readier speech, he
would have tried somehow to make the
sorrowing boy realize that there were
other worlds to conquer, wider and more
inspiring fields in the years beyond. Yet
there was something quite fine in this
absorption in the crew; it was what one
ought to feel at twenty-one, and it might
be better for him to fight it out alone.
The Stroke was glad when the youngster
marched out of the room without more
words. "I hope he stands the gaff,"
thought the elder man.</p>

<p>Hastings' first impulse had been to flee
the place, and he was still busy with the
longing to be anywhere away from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
sights and sounds that racked him because
they were so infinitely much to him.
While he struggled with the decision, the
eight began to make ready for the long
afternoon practice. As the shell swung
out of sight around the curve of the shore,
Hastings had not believed it possible that
any one could feel as lonely and neglected
as he at that moment. Just then he saw
a University substitute standing idly in
the boathouse door, and he remembered
that with one transferred to the eight, and
another laid off with a cold, this youngster,
Bates, was the sole survivor of the
trio which had its own thankless duties
and burdens. The intending fugitive
made a choice then and there, as he slid
down the bank, shouting:</p>

<p>"Aren't you going out to-day to keep
tabs on the Red-Heads?"</p>

<p>The solitary substitute ruefully shook
his head:</p>

<p>"No, I haven't any one to man the pair-oar
with me, and I'm no good in a single
shell. And I ought to be over at the start
right now, for the tip is out that Harvard
is going to try the four miles on time, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
last attempt. How am I going to catch
their time, I want to know, with nobody to
help me?"</p>

<p>Hastings laid hold of the bow of the
pair-oared boat as he said:</p>

<p>"Get hold of the other end of the tub,
and we'll put her in the water. I might as
well be a substitute, too, if there is work
for me to do. We'll hold the watch on the
Johnny Harvards in great shape."</p>

<p>The substitute glimpsed something of
the sacrifice and struggle in Hastings'
offer to help him, but he could not know
it all, because he was only a "sub." The
two were bending over their stretchers
lacing the shoes, when the launch slipped
past the float so quietly that the substitutes
did not hear it. The Head Coach, however,
standing on the forward deck, heard
Hastings say to his mate with an evident
effort:</p>

<p>"I came pretty near playing the baby
act and running away, but if I can help
the Yale shell to go faster by being out
of it, I am glad of it. That's what I am
rowing for, anyhow. And if I can be of
any use as a substitute, why, that's what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
I am here for, too. It is all for Yale,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>The two in the pair-oar rowed across
the river, landed a half mile above the
start of the four-mile course, and walked
down the railroad track.</p>

<p>"We can't do anything more than catch
their time over the first mile," observed
the experienced Bates; "but that will give
us a good line on the gait they are going."
Hastings meekly followed instructions to
hurry to the hill opposite the first-mile
flag, and be ready to wave his handkerchief
when the Harvard crew should pass
him. Bates, at the start with a stop
watch, would snap the time at this signal.
In dust and quivering heat, Hastings
trudged along the ties, crept up the hill
and lay on his stomach under a tree, waiting
the appearance of the Harvard crew.
The tears could not be held back at
thought of this humiliation, of the abysmal
gap between this petty spying in
ambush, and all the days in which he had
swung by this first-mile flag in the University
eight.</p>

<p>There was much time for meditation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and while the first shock had wrecked his
every hope, he began to patch the fabric
of his dearest dream, until he was ready to
believe that, even more clearly than his
mother, Cynthia Wells would understand.
She would see that he had tried to do his
best, that the failure was blackened by
nothing left undone, and that his great
disappointment was of a piece with those
troubles which knit closer the bonds of
friendship. She would know that it was
"all for Yale," that winning the race was
more important than anything else in the
world, and he ached for the words of comfort
and inspiration she would be so eager
to offer. If friendship meant anything
it meant help in such times as this.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>On the day before the race Hastings'
occupation as a substitute was gone. The
shadow of the morrow was over the Quarters,
the atmosphere was funereal, and the
strapping oarsmen were coddled like infants.
He had no part in the excitement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and was free to meet his mother in New
York that afternoon. The news he must
bear her made him as nervous as if he were
facing the tussle of the eights. After
farewells with his other comrades he
sought the Stroke, who grasped the hand
of the sorrowful exile in a crushing grip.</p>

<p>"Keep your nerve, Jack," said he; "it
will all come out in the wash. I know
there's a girl in it, and if she is the right
sort, she will understand."</p>

<p>Hastings flushed at mention of the
feminine factor, as he stammered:</p>

<p>"Of course she will understand. She
is that kind, all right. But I hope to
Heaven I'll never clap eyes on Gales
Ferry again. Damn the place! Good-bye.
You've been a brick to me, and lots
of comfort."</p>

<p>After he had gone, the Stroke looked
up from his book for some time, while a
tender smile softened his strong mouth.
He had found a girl who could understand,
and he hoped the same good fortune
for his friend.</p>

<p>When the train passed through New
Haven, Hastings wore a hang-dog air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
fearing recognition. A runaway from
New London the day before the race, his
college town was the last place on earth
in which he wished to be seen. As he
neared New York he braced himself for
the meeting with his mother, blindly fearing
that she would be sorely disappointed
in him. But the <i>Mohican</i> had been delayed
by heavy weather along the coast
and a smothering fog off Sandy Hook,
and could not be expected to reach her
dock before seven o'clock of the following
morning.</p>

<p>Hastings felt as if he were cast away
on a desert island. He yearned for his
mother now, but she was somewhere out
in the fog, and he was alone in New York,
alone through the long night before the
race, with all its smarting, thrilling memories.
Long after midnight, unable to
coax drowsiness, his thoughts went homing
back to the Quarters as he knew the
place in these last hours.</p>

<p>He could hear the call of the robin at
daybreak in the tree by his window, the
call that had aroused him to face the issues
of two races when he was Number Five.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
He could picture the morning scenes, the
hush of lawn and house, the enforced
lounging on bed and sofa until the summons
to be ready and dressed at the boathouse.</p>

<p>Then he recalled the tense waiting on
the float for the call of the whistle of the
referee's yacht, how the year before they
had sat together in the sunshine and sung
the chorus of "Jolly Boating Weather."
Since then it had become to him a battle
song, a chant profoundly burdened with
sentiment and solemnity. He could not
hear it without feeling a lump in his
breast. Now the shell would be launched,
the men seating themselves with unusual
care, and the coaches would shake hands
from stroke to bow as the eight shoved
off to row over to the start.... He
wiped the sweat from his face and came
back to the stifling room of the hotel in
New York, and the sense of cruel isolation.</p>

<p>It was almost daylight when Hastings
fell asleep, more tired than he knew, and
when he awoke, a glance at his watch told
him that he had overslept, and that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
nearly ten o'clock. The reply to a frantic
telephone message was that all the passengers
of the <i>Mohican</i> had gone ashore
shortly after eight o'clock. His mother
had gone to New London without him,
and the express train into which he dove
was due to arrive at the scene of conflict
barely in time to connect with the observation
train, if all conditions favored. Ten
minutes behind time, he was running
through the New London station, as the
tail of the rearward observation cars was
vanishing around a curve of the track
yard, with cheering in its wake.</p>

<p>Vainly pursuing on foot, Hastings
came to a standstill, stranded and alone,
unable even to see the race, about to start
five miles up the river. Walking down
to the nearest wharf, he could see through
the arches of the great railroad bridge the
festooned yachts stretching in squadrons
beyond, and between them only a little
patch of silver lane where the crews would
finish.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Shortly after noon, there stepped from
the first "special" into New London a
fragile yet sprightly little woman in rustling
black, alone, but confident and
unafraid. Her sweet face was made beautiful,
even youthful, by the flush of excitement
that tinted her cheek so delicately
beneath her silvered hair. Violets were
pinned at her waist; in one hand she carried
a flag of Yale blue, and in the other
a decorative souvenir programme "containing
the pictures of all the crews."
Those near her in the car had watched
with pleasure her vivacious interest in this
booklet, but only the gentleman sitting
next her had been taken into her confidence.
Thirty years out of college, he
was come from the far West to his class
reunion, and he, too, had a boy in Yale.
Fortunately or otherwise, he had not kept
in touch with the most recent news of the
heroic figures of aquatics, and he knew
not even the names of the crew of the
year at Yale, so that she could enlighten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
his lamentable ignorance and right willingly.
The "souvenir" booklet had been
printed a week before the race, too soon
to record the change in the <i>personnel</i> of
the Yale eight, and there was her boy's
picture filling a page, a massive young
giant, most scantily clothed. The man
from the West saw in the picture the
mother's brown eyes, and his heart was
stirred, for he knew what it was to have
an only son with his mother's eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, John has been on the crew three
years," she confided, "and he will be the
captain next year. I fairly live with him
in spirit through the whole six months of
the training season. He has had a very
hard time this season, and lately his letters
have been a little despondent. But I was
never so delighted as when I learned from
the head-lines of this morning's newspapers
that there has been a wonderful
improvement in the last week. Oh, I am
excited, there is no use trying to deny it.
It is almost too big an event for an old
woman to survive."</p>

<p>The gray-haired stranger was comforting,
and in the recesses of his memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
found certain eulogies pronounced by his
son regarding "Jack Hastings, the biggest
man in his class, by Jove!" He insisted
upon presenting two of his own
classmates, and they bowed low in formal
tribute to the "mother of the next captain
of the crew."</p>

<p>The porter must leave her bag in the
station, for she could not wait to go to the
boarding house when the air was full of
tingling sights and sounds, all the excitement
and flaunting color paying homage
to the prowess of John Hastings. She
found Car Fifteen, and sat in a beautiful
dream, watching the holiday crowds fill
the canopied lengths of open train. What
a tale to tell when she should come again
to the little colorless village in the South!
It seemed impossible to drink it all in
when the train began to move and in a
few moments the amazing panorama of
the Thames flashed into view. The eager
eyes of the oarsman's mother passed
quickly over the gorgeous marine pictures,
by the twisting length of the riotous
train, up, up the river toward the quiet
reaches, hoping to discern the white house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
on the high bank and the big blue flag
floating above the Quarters at Gales
Ferry, a scene she knew from many descriptions.</p>

<p>Soon the train had passed the yachts
and the crowds massed on shore, and was
opposite the red-roofed home of the Harvard
crew, whose crimson flag seemed to
her to flaunt an insolent defiance. In
near-by cars fluttered many Harvard
flags, as the partisans from Cambridge
chanted their slogan, inspired by the sight
of their rowing camp across the river.
She turned to look at the offenders with
reproof in her manner. How could they
be so misguided as to cheer for Harvard?
How dreadful it was to think that if John
should be beaten, every one of them would
be shouting even louder for joy. So she
turned to gaze at the Yale Quarters,
which she could see quite plainly, and the
ugly brown boathouse squatted at the
water's edge.</p>

<p>Her color came and went, and stayed in
a brilliant patch when she saw, with a
quick intake of breath, a yellow streak
appear in front of the boathouse and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
number of Lilliputians walking beside
it. There seemed an eternity of delay
before the wisp of a shell settled on
the water, and nine figures climbed into
it, while her heart was tripping furiously.</p>

<p>The thing became in motion, it was
crawling across the river like a mechanical
toy, with frequent pauses. Could this be
the Crew, this fragile thing that moved
over the water so slowly? A roar from
the Harvard cars, and Mrs. Hastings
turned to see a similar set of manikins
swaying in as absurd a boat, heading out
from "Red Top." The mother looked at
them only for an instant, because the Yale
crew was crossing the river faster than
she could realize, and soon it was half a
mile above the start, paddling and drifting
down with the tide to get into position
at its stake-boat. She wanted to call imploringly
to the referee to bring the crew
nearer, nearer, so that she might see the
men, and count from the bow, to two,
three, four, <i>five</i>. Presently the shell
swung round, parallel with the shore, and
maneuvered into position scarcely twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
yards from the observation train hanging
on the edge of the bank.</p>

<p>At last the mother could look for Number
Five. She counted with an eager and
quivering finger. No, she must have made
a mistake&mdash;that was not John at Number
Five. They must have shifted him to another
seat at the last moment.</p>

<p>She flung away all method and searched
the stern young faces from stroke to bow,
from bow to stroke and back again, with
yearning agony of intensity. She made
bold to ask that the gentleman next her
lend her his field-glasses for a moment, and
focused them on the shell, seeking in
vain. The color had fled from her cheeks,
and she sat back, white and silent, beyond
speech. Around her raved the cheers of
thousands, but the rocketing "rahs" for
Yale sounded in her ears like some barbaric
funeral chant. She had become old
and weak far beyond her years.</p>

<p>Her distress was unnoticed, and through
a haze she saw the long shells leap from
their leashes with incredible suddenness
in tearing cascades of foam. To the
mourning mother the race was no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
than an exhibition of automatons, as Harvard
took the lead, and then the long Yale
swing cut it down remorselessly, foot by
foot, until the gap was closed. She closed
her eyes with a weary sigh, but rallied in
a little while to try to make herself heard
above the din. Yale was spurting gallantly,
and those around her were oblivious
to the quavering voice and its vital
questions:</p>

<p>"Where is John Hastings? Number
Five in the Yale Crew? Where has he
gone? What have they done with him?
Oh, tell me, tell me, tell me, please. I am
his mother."</p>

<p>Yale hopes drooped as Harvard met
the spurt, and in the lull a young man
of a kindly face saw that she was ill, and
leaned toward her to ask whether he
could help. She was able to make him
understand, and there was a huskiness in
his voice that came not all from cheering,
as he said:</p>



<p>"Why, he's all right, safe and sound as
a dollar. He was taken out of the boat
four or five days ago, and Matthews put
in his place. No, I don't know what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
matter was. Too heavy, I fancy. I'm
awfully sorry for you."</p>

<div class="figcenter2em" id="i074"><img src="images/i074.jpg" width="400"
height="496" alt="" title="" />
<div class="caption">
<i>Jack Hasting's mother cannot find her boy in the crew.</i></div></div>


<p class="p2">Where else should a boy flee in time of
trouble than straight to his mother's arms?
Therefore the reason for his disappearance
must be an alarming one. Then she
felt a blaze of swift anger. It was an
outrageous act of injustice, this deed of
the Yale coaches. They were no better
than conspirators thus to treat the best
oarsman they had. It was not in a
mother's philosophy to grasp the view-point
that what was best for Yale was
best for all who fought for its glory.
She vowed that a reckoning was due, and
that her duty was to see these coaches,
and tell them the truth before she left the
scene. And so, between wrath and tears,
she saw the race end, saw the Yale crew
sweep across the finish line, victors over
Harvard by four lengths. This was what
she had come to see, what she had lived
in the hope of seeing through three long
years, and now all had turned to ashes.</p>

<p>Wearily she threaded a way through
the thronging railroad station, found a
cab and gave the driver directions for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
reaching the boarding house where a room
awaited her. Her steps faltered as she
toiled up the stairs, and all that gave her
strength for the ascent was the flicker of
hope that John might be there, or that
some message had come from him. The
room was empty, the table bare of letter
or telegram. Carefully laying her bonnet
and jacket on a chair, she looked at her
face in a mirror, and it frightened her.
Although she was eager to be out again in
search of the way to Gales Ferry, rest
was imperative, and she crossed over to
the bed and lay down for a few moments
until the dizzy faintness should pass.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>When John Hastings drifted down to
the wharf nearest the railroad station, he
laid an almost aimless course. While he
could not see the race, he was drawn to
the harbor into which flowed the river, the
river by whose bank, five miles away, his
comrades were waiting for the summons,
and perhaps even then singing "Jolly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Boating Weather," as it was never sung
at any other time.</p>

<p>Through the maze of fragile shipping
flying the flags of a dozen yacht clubs
threaded a naphtha launch hurrying toward
the bridge, the cock-pit gay with
white gowns and blue uniforms, and Yale
colors fluttering at bow and stern. The
outcast bestowed no more than a scowling
glance on the glittering, humming pleasure
craft, and was about to saunter shoreward
with a vague intent of hovering near
the telegraph office until the result of the
race should be known, when the beckoning
flurry of several handkerchiefs delayed
his retreat.</p>

<p>He walked to the end of the wharf in
idlest curiosity, and the possibility staggered
him only an instant before he knew
the fact. There was no mistaking the
trim and jaunty figure in the bow for
any one else than Cynthia Wells herself,
as she flicked the steering wheel over and
ran the craft close to the stringpiece,
while the sailor in the stern held fast with
a boat hook. Her voice was lifted in peremptory
command:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"Scramble right down here this minute,
and tumble aboard, Jack. We are awfully
late already. Broke down on the
way from the <i>Diana</i>. I don't know what
in the world you are doing here, but
we can't pass such an image of desolation.
Hurry, please. I am the skipper
to-day."</p>

<p>Jack would have vastly preferred to
run away. This meeting was not at all
what he had planned. His misery loved
company limited to one, and that one was
hedged about by half a dozen laughing
men and girls out for a holiday lark. He
realized how sorry a figure of a man he
was in this scene, but retreat meant cowardly
flight, and there was the shadow of
consolation in being near her. The grip
of "Dickie" Munson's hand spelled understanding
of the situation as the classmate
said:</p>

<p>"We're tickled to death to kidnap you
this way, Jack. It's a tough day for you,
I know, but you must not miss the race.
Get forward. There's room by Miss
Wells, and, of course, she is dying to see
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>When he found himself standing by the
side of Cynthia, she was alert and absorbed
in steering the launch with confident
ease toward the swirling channel
between the arches of the bridge, where
small craft darted and drifted in common
eagerness to find positions along the last
mile of the swarming course.</p>

<p>The jolly wind whipped a straying lock
of gold-shot hair across her eyes, and she
brushed it aside with an impatient gesture.
Her adorable face, warm with the glow
of many summer days of sun and breeze,
was set in serious alertness. Standing
straight and tall, head thrown back and
shoulders squared, the poise and look of
her were as athletic as the bearing of the
man at her side. With her mind wholly
intent on the business in hand, she said
crisply:</p>

<p>"I have the right of way over that tub
to port. Why doesn't he head inshore?
How is the tide through that middle arch,
Jack? You ought to know."</p>

<p>He made brief reply. Unreasonably
sensitive, he did not realize that her preoccupation
was essential. At the least, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
had expected she would speak some ready
word of the sympathy he craved, because
he stood for a tragedy in which she ought
to show concern. Did she not know, could
she not feel what this flight up the course
meant to him, "Jack Hastings, Number
Five"? But the girl at the wheel was too
busy even to note the gloom in his face, as
she shot the launch into a roomy berth
near the three and a half mile flag, at the
edge of the streak of open water. Then
Cynthia turned to Hastings, held out a
firm brown hand, and said with a happy
smile:</p>

<p>"There, congratulate me. Could your
coxswain, with his absurd little megaphone
and all his importance, do a neater
trick of steering than that? Now, you
poor unfortunate boy, I am ready to hear
all about your troubles. We heard yesterday,
when we came ashore at New London,
that you had been evicted, or had
gone on strike, or something of the sort.
Are you all broken up over it, and how
did it happen? I am terribly disappointed,
too. I came on to see you win a
race. I don't care a rap for the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
heroes. Poor old Jack! He looks as if
he were chief mourner."</p>

<p>She patted his hand with a motherly
air, and the mourner sighed heavily.
Evidently she was making a gallant effort
to hide her genuine emotion from the
alien company. He tried to imitate her
lightness of manner as he replied, with a
laugh that was a trifle shaky:</p>

<p>"Yes, I have been out of the crew four
days, Cynthia, and it seems four years. It
was awfully good of you to pick me up,
but I don't know whether I am glad or
not. Perhaps you ought to have left me
alone."</p>

<p>"And why, Mister Knight of the Sorrowful
Countenance? Didn't you want
to see me?"</p>

<p>There was archness in the query, even a
trace of pretty coquetry in her air. Where
was the kinship of souls, that wonderful
symphony of understanding he had
dreamed of as come true? With a fierce
onset of earnestness, he confided:</p>

<p>"I wanted to see you more than any one
else in the world. I wanted to see you
more than I wanted to see my mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
She is looking for me now. She is on that
train up yonder. It has been a pretty hard
day for me, and I thought it would be for
you."</p>

<p>She tried to make amends:</p>

<p>"Why, of course, it is a dreadful disappointment
for you, and for me, and for
all your friends, Jack. But aren't you
glad it gave you the chance to be here? I
certainly am. And I'm trying to make
the best of it, and so must you. You are
the same old Jack, you know, in the crew
or out."</p>

<p>The first smile in days broke over his
face. If he was the same old Jack to her,
the rest of the world could go hang. He
was about to tell her what he ached to reveal
in a rush of pent-up desire, what the
Crew stood for, and how much of his life
was bound up in it. She caught the kindling
light in his face, and before he
spoke, she thought this light was all for
her. That his interest should be absorbed
in the crew, rather than in Miss Cynthia
Wells, piqued her, even now, as he began:</p>

<p>"I was afraid the crash was coming for
some time. Nobody can know how I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
hoped and worried through those weeks,
when I felt that I was slipping back. I
did not write you about it, because I could
not believe there was any serious danger
of my being thrown out at the last moment,
and I knew it would harrow you to
share this worry with me. I&mdash;I&mdash;wanted
your&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The classmate behind him jumped to
his feet and shouted:</p>

<p>"There they come! Yale! Yale! Yale!"</p>

<p>Hastings glanced along the water
level up-river. Two black dots were visible,
each fluttering thread-like tentacles.
Abreast of them trailed the observation
train, like a huge serpent of gaudy hues.
He bit his lip and trembled with sudden
excitement, while Cynthia Wells stood,
one hand shading her eyes, so eagerly intent
that it was plain that she had forgotten
the oarsman out of the shell. The sea
of blue, rippling along the train, told him
that Yale was leading. He shut his eyes,
fearing, until it sickened him, that some
accident might happen to Yale, even with
what seemed to be a safe lead.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>To those who did not know, the winners
seemed to be playing with rowing as they
swept toward the finish. With no apparent
effort the blue-tipped blades flashed
in and out, without even a feather of
spray. Forward and back again rocked
eight bare backs, working as if coupled on
the same connecting rod. Hands slipped
easily into arched and heaving chests,
and shot out with lightning speed; slow,
slower, swooped the shoulders squared
beneath necks like fluted columns and
heads poised with airy grace. As Hastings
leaned far out on the bow of the
launch, waving his hat in a fury of approval,
the shell rushed by him not twenty
feet away, and the complaining roar of
the slides was music in his ears. He could
feel with that agony of effort to keep in
form when every muscle cried out in rebellion,
and the choking fight for breath,
and yet, with it all, the glory of making
the swing and catch fairly lift the quivering
shell. And he knew, also, the in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>toxication
of the sight of the Harvard
crew laboring astern, as seen through eyes
half blinded with sweat.</p>

<p>Hastings was lifted out of himself until
he saw his crew cease rowing and the
oars trail like the wings of a tired bird.
Then the defeated crew went past him.
There were breaks in the swing, heads
nodded on the catch, backs were bending,
and bodies swaying athwartships. It was
anything now to cross the line and rest.</p>

<p>Hastings had a new realization of what
these whipped oarsmen felt, they whose
high hopes were wrecked, whose labor, as
long and as faithful as that of the winners,
had gone for nought. After all, he
did not belong with the winners, he was
one of the losers, and he wished he might
shake their hands. He cheered with all
his voice, and Number Five of Harvard
turned a drawn face to this salutation so
close at hand, and in a quick glance recognized
his dethroned rival, whom he had
once met on the lawn at Gales Ferry. The
man in the boat flashed a smile of comradeship
to the man in the launch, and
both felt better for the incident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Cynthia was clapping her hands, then
she tore the violets from her gown and
flung them as far as she could toward the
distant crew.</p>

<p>"Yale! Yale!" she cried. "Cast off. I
want to work the launch down that way
to see them. Wasn't it glorious? Oh, I
never saw anything half so fine. I want
to shake their hands, every one of that
beautiful, blessed crew. I'd give ten
years of my life to be one of those men at
this moment."</p>

<p>She had not looked at Jack, but he was
determined to obtrude himself somehow.</p>

<p>"How about the man who worked just
as hard, and gets none of this hero worship?
Doesn't he deserve anything from
you?"</p>

<p>"Poor old Jack!" she said tenderly.
"Why, I forgot all about you for a little
while. It is a shame you are not there.
You ought to have tried just a little bit
harder, hadn't you? Now you can't be a
hero, but don't you care. We are all sorry
as sorry as can be."</p>

<p>The launch had daringly poked a passage
close to the float on to which the crew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
was now clambering from the shell. Big
brown, half-naked men were hugging
each other, and clumsily dancing in stockinged
feet. Eagerly Cynthia asked her
companion:</p>

<p>"Do tell me which is which, Jack. I
want to be able to know them all by name.
Which is the Stroke, and which is the man
at Number Five? I want to see if he
looks like you."</p>

<p>Hastings gave the information very
soberly. The Stroke caught sight of his
clouded face, and yelled to his fellows:</p>

<p>"Hey, here's Jack Hastings! Three
long cheers for him. Are you ready?"</p>

<p>The cheer given by men still struggling
to regain their normal breathing
came so gratefully to John Hastings
that he felt like whimpering, because <i>they</i>
understood. The launch was deftly
steered alongside the float, and grabbing
the outstretched hand of Hastings, the
Stroke nearly pulled him overboard, as
he whispered:</p>

<p>"Jack, I am glad you could see the race
with the Only One. It must have helped
you over the rough places. There is noth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>ing
like it when things look blue. God
bless you both. Where is your mother?
Be sure to come down to New Haven to-night,
won't you?"</p>

<p>The Stroke jumped to help load the
oars on the coaching launch just as Cynthia
said to Hastings:</p>

<p>"Why didn't you present me? I think
you are a stupid old Jack."</p>

<p>Where was his mother? Guilty and
ashamed, he stammered:</p>

<p>"Please set me ashore anywhere as soon
as you can, and I shall be eternally grateful."</p>

<p>She pouted.</p>

<p>"Do you want to leave me so soon?
Certainly, I will put you ashore if you
wish. You have been as cross as a bear.
You must do penance by coming off to
dinner to-night."</p>

<p>"Thanks, I have another engagement,"
said he shortly.</p>

<p>The observation train had gone to the
station, and it must be emptied of its
freight by this time. There was no more
time for talk with Cynthia, and he did not
know what else to say to her to whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
day was an outing, vastly exciting and enjoyable.
Still, he sought one last word of
sincere realization of his ill fortune, and
found no response to his own heart hunger.
He said "Good-bye," as he stepped
ashore, and holding her hand for a moment:</p>

<p>"I am glad that you have had such a
pleasant afternoon, Cynthia. A friend in
need is a friend indeed."</p>

<p>The tribute touched and pleased her,
and the irony of it wholly escaped her,
as she gayly called after him:</p>

<p>"Be sure you don't forget to look us up
to-night."</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Hastings did not look behind him, as with
lowered head he ran along the railroad
track to the station, jumped into a cab and
urged the driver to speed to the house
where his mother must be waiting.</p>

<p>Some one within heard his footstep,
knew it for what she craved most to hear,
and was in the doorway of her room, when
he saw her. Picking her up like a child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
he covered her white hair, her tired face,
her hands with kisses, and as she clung
weeping on his breast, he carried her to
a big armchair in the bay window. He
was on his knees with his rumpled head in
her lap when she found broken voice to
say:</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack, are you well? Are you all
right? My own precious boy! I have
come to comfort and love you. Nothing
else matters. Nothing else matters to me,
now that I have found you safe and
sound."</p>

<p>She twisted her slim fingers in his thick
brown hair, and as she felt the warm pressure
of his head in her lap, the years had
stepped aside, and he was the little boy
who used to flee to that dear sanctuary in
every time of trial. And to her this was
only another trouble, which only Mother
could understand and clear from his path.
When at length he looked up, she was
shocked to see the shadow circles under
his eyes, and the nervous twitching of the
mouth that was so very like his mother's.
He was sobbing, and not ashamed of it,
as he murmured:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have been disgraced and disappointed,
but I don't care any more now
that I have found you. Are you all right,
Little Mother? Did you think I had deserted
you?"</p>

<p>She told him of the race as she had seen
it, and was with difficulty dissuaded from
planning to search out the Head Coach,
crying with the angry sparkle he loved
of old:</p>

<p>"It is not ladylike, Jack, but I would
like to scratch his horrid eyes out. Of
course, he should have kept you on the
crew, but we are not going to cry over
spilt milk, are we? I want you to tell me
all about it&mdash;everything&mdash;so that we can
look and find some consolation. Every
cloud has a silver lining."</p>

<p>While he carried the tale down to the
parting with Cynthia she smiled and
frowned in turn, and wiped her eyes before
he had finished. A mother's intuition
read between the lines and when the
rueful confession halted, her arm stole
around his neck, and she kissed him again.</p>

<p>"It is a sad story," she said; "but never
let me hear that word disgrace as long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
you live. Of course, I was nearly killed
about it to-day, and I should have been
crying for four nights at sea if I could
have heard the news before I started.
But it would have been only because you
were unhappy and disappointed. What
else are mothers for than to understand
when the world seems upside down?
When you were seven years old, you were
kept home from a Sunday-school picnic
by the chicken-pox, and you told me in
floods of tears that you didn't 'b'lieve you
could never, never be happy again.' I
knew how small your world was, and that
the chicken-pox was big enough to fill it
to overflowing.</p>

<p>"Now you have tried your best, you
rowed as well as you knew how, and the
crew was everything to you, just as it
ought to be. But some day you may have
larger troubles, and they, too, shall pass
away, and more and more you will come
back to the simple gospel of living I have
tried to teach you, that there is only one
standard by which to judge success or
failure. Is the thing worth while, and
have you done your best in the best way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to gain it? I don't mean to preach, my
boy mine. You don't want that. You
want your mother. I know, I know."</p>

<p>She stroked his cheek as he went deep
into his heart, and brought up more than
he had ever told her before of his dreams
of love, first love, and of what he had been
building. His mother knew that she must
be careful, and she hesitated, as if pondering
how best to speak her view-point.</p>

<p>"She did not understand, poor girl. It
is not all her fault, and it is not yours,
laddie boy. When the race began and I
saw that you were not in the crew, it
seemed as if I were in the depths of a
bad dream. I was with you all the way,
and I thought of nothing else. And I
know that while you would have been with
me if you could, yet if the girl were here
you would wish in your heart to find her
first. No, don't try to deny it. But she
did not know at all what it meant to you,
she could not know. But if she had loved
you, she would have understood as I did.
We will talk about her all night if it will
make your heartache any better. What
are we going to do now?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy straightened himself and threw
back his wide shoulders, because his mother
saw no cause for reproach in his downfall.
But he did not want to see the crew again,
and he wished to avoid the riotous celebration
soon to burst. Obviously the best
plan was to go to New Haven at once,
where they could find refuge in his rooms,
and pack his trunk for the vacation departure.</p>

<p>To him this little journey from New
London was a panic flight, to her it was
made radiant by the one fact that her boy
had come back to her. After dinner, in a
quiet corner of the college town, they
went to his rooms on the campus. The
sight of the two twelve-foot oars on the
walls, his own trophies of two victories,
their handles stained dark with the sweat
of his hands, made her turn to him as they
entered:</p>

<p>"Nothing can ever take those away
from you, with all their splendid story of
success."</p>

<p>The boy looked at them for an instant,
then brushed a hand across his tired young
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Better make kindling of them," he
said. "Look at that one over there. I
won it as a raw, overgrown Freshman, and
three years later I can't do as well as I
did then. Matthews, 'the sub,' will hang
my third oar on his wall next year. I am
going to curl up on the window-seat and
rest a while, Mother. I feel all played
out."</p>

<p>She, too, was very tired, but felt that
her son had need of her, and she tried to
soothe him to sleep, and smiled as she
found herself half unconsciously humming
a slumber-song she had crooned to
him twenty years before. Her photograph
was on his desk, and framed near it the
winsome face of Cynthia Wells, and she
crossed the room to look closely and comprehendingly
at the girl who had acted in
her own world as naturally as had the
youth in his. When she returned to the
window, her son was asleep, and she softly
kissed him.</p>

<p>Looking across the green, she saw a
blaze of red fire that colored the evening
sky. Rockets and Roman candles began
to spangle the illumination, and presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the far-away blare of a brass band crept
nearer. She knew that these were signs
of the home-coming of the crew, of the
celebration whose glories Jack had eloquently
portrayed. It was not disloyalty
to him that she should want to see what it
was like, although she knew he would not
want to be there. Yet feeling traitorish
qualms, she scribbled a little note, saying
she had gone out for a "breath of fresh
air," and stole down the staircase.</p>

<p>When she came to the corner the procession
was rioting up Chapel Street toward
the campus. The band preceded a
tally-ho, on top of which were the heroes
in their white boating uniforms, nervously
dodging innumerable fiery darts aimed
straight at them by wild-eyed admirers on
the pavement. Behind, surging from
curb to curb, skipped thousands of students
and townspeople, arm in arm, in
common rapture. The wavering line of
fireworks told that the tail of the parade
was blocks and blocks away.</p>

<p>The coach was stopped at the corner of
the campus, as a hundred agile figures
swarmed up the wheels, and dragged the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
crew to earth, from which they were instantly
caught up, and borne on tossing
shoulders to the stone steps of the nearest
recitation hall. There they were held
aloft, still struggling, while cheers greeted
each by name.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Now the celebration programme would
have been halting and inadequate if the
Assistant Manager of the Yale Navy had
not hurried to New Haven on an earlier
train. He had been in the car with John
Hastings, and took it for granted that the
sweet-faced woman of the silvery hair
must be his mother. He was plunging
through the crowd on the stone steps, trying
to rescue the oarsmen in order to head
them toward the banquet hall, when beneath
the are light on the corner, a little
way out of the tumult, he saw the timid
lady for whom he had felt much sympathy.
The Assistant Manager was ably
fitted for his official task of looking after
details, because he fairly boiled over with
initiative, and with him to think was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
act, as the powder speeds the bullet. He
dashed across to Mrs. Hastings, and said,
with a hurried and apologetic bow:</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, but this is Jack Hastings'
mother, are you not? Yes, thank you,
I was sure of it. It may seem presumptuous,
but I have heard lots about you, and
Jack has convinced me that you are the
finest mother in the world, bar one. I have
been so infern&mdash;so very busy since I got
in town from New London, that I have
had no time to look up Jack. We want
him at the dinner, everybody does, and we
want you just as much. In fact, you must
be my special guest, and hear the speeches,
anyhow, if you won't stay any longer.
Jack's asleep, is he? Well, we'll wake
him up, all right."</p>

<p>The alarmed little mother tried to protest
several things at once. Jack had
sworn he would not go to the dinner, and
that he would break the neck of the man
who should try to rout him out. Of
course, Jack would not do that really, but
he was all worn out and needed the rest.
Please not to disturb him, and she would
not dream of going without him, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
did not want to go at all. Her earnestness
was almost tearful, but the Assistant
Manager, who had heard perhaps the first
ten words, darted off and was back with
two young men whose fists were full of
cannon crackers. He had each fast by
the coat-collar, and shoving them into the
foreground like a pair of marionettes, he
breathlessly blurted:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hastings, may I present Mr.
Stower and Mr. 'Stuffy' Barlow, both
Seniors, highly dignified and proper persons?
This is Jack Hastings' mother.
You are to escort Mrs. Hastings down to
Harmonium Hall, and see that she has a
nice seat in the gallery or near the door.
No trouble at all, Mrs. Hastings, I assure
you. Awfully glad to have had the honor
of meeting you. Good-bye. I'll run over
to Jack's room and drag him down there
in five minutes."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hastings had all the sensations of
being kidnapped. She tried to protest,
even to resist, but was like a leaf caught
up in a torrent, as Messrs. Barlow and
Stower, both talking at once, handed her
politely but firmly into the depths of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
hack, climbed in after her and slammed
the door.</p>

<p>Almost in a twinkling, as it seemed to
the agitated mother, she was being ushered
carefully into a small music gallery overlooking
the banquet floor, where from a
shadowy corner she could overlook the festivities
in semi-seclusion. She waited only
until her genial abductors were out of
sight, and then slipped furtively toward
the stairs, intending, of course, to return
to her boy if he did not appear forthwith.
Uneasy and fluttering, she was also keenly
interested, for had not John placed this
picture before her, and what it had meant
to him in other years? He met her at the
top of the stairway, looking sheepish and
alarmed. She tried to explain, but he cut
her short with a laugh:</p>

<p>"I know all about it, Little Mother.
You fell a victim to the wiles of a terrible
set of villains. You couldn't help yourself.
Neither could I, when I heard how
you had been spirited away. Now you are
going to stay and see the fun, aren't you?"</p>

<p>She tried to persuade him to leave her
and take his seat with the celebrants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I have lost my seat," said he, with
the old shadow on his face. "I don't belong
there any more.... I don't
want to be seen. But the fellows promised
not to give me away. It is pretty
nervy for me to come at all. But I am
here only to escort you."</p>

<p>She took his hand and held it while they
sat well back in a corner of the gallery
and watched the company trooping in.
To the young oarsmen, so clean-cut and
strong, tired but happy, all their woes
and fears forgotten, this was their day of
days. In a long row were seated the University
eight, the substitutes, and the
Freshman crew, which had also won its
race. At the head of the table was "Big
Bill" Hall, stout oarsman of thirty years
ago, now a much stouter citizen. The
captain of the crew was at his right, and
at his left hand the beaming Head Coach,
burned as black as any Indian. In another
group were the younger coaches, most of
them old strokes and captains, and mighty
men at Yale in their time. Other oarsmen
of other days were welcomed, regardless
of the formality of invitation. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
forty men around the board had known
the test of the four-mile course, brothers
of the oar through nearly two generations
of rowing history.</p>

<p>The outcast was able to keep his poise
until the Glee Club quartette rose to sing,
by special request of the Head Coach,
"Jolly Boating Weather." The first
tenor had a sweet and sympathetic voice,
and he had heard the story of the singing
of this song on the float just before the
race, wherefore he did the verses uncommonly
well.</p>

<p>Then the old fellows, some with grizzled
thatches, and some with thatches
scant and thin, had their innings and
pounded the table to emphasize their harmonious
declaration that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Twenty years hence such weather</div>
<div class="line i1">Will tempt us from office stools.</div>
<div class="line">We may be slow on the feather,</div>
<div class="line i1">And seem to the boys old fools,</div>
<div class="line">But we'll still swing together&mdash;&mdash;"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The song carried to Hastings was the
last straw to break the endurance which
had pulled him through the long, long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
day. He did not want his mother to see
his quivering lip, and he thought she
would not perceive that he was near to
breaking down. Did she know? Why,
she felt his emotion in the hand she clasped
tighter than before, she read his thoughts
in the very beat of his pulse, and when he
whispered that he must have caught a cold
in the head because he was getting an attack
of sniffles, she needed no words to
enlighten her understanding. If his tears
were those of a boy, then she thanked God
she was childish enough to feel with him
at every step and turn of the way that was
blocked by the biggest sorrow of his life.
She asked him whether he would like to
go home. He shook his head and said that
he would stick it through to the end.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Speeches were in order, and the presiding
alumnus hove himself out of his chair,
and hammered the table with the rudder
of the winning shell, thoughtfully lifted
and provided by the able Assistant Manager.
There were cheers for "Big Bill"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Hall, of the '73 crew, more cheers for
Yale, and before the uproar was quiet his
great voice rose above it as he began to
speak. Presiding Judge of the Supreme
Court of a New England State when at
home, he was all a Yale man come back to
his own upon such occasions as this, and
because Yale men loved him they called
him "Big Bill."</p>

<p>"When we get into the big world beyond
the campus," he began, "it may seem
to some that this intensity of purpose, this
absorption in a sport, were childish, yet
we do not regret those convictions, we are
proud of them, for these same qualities
make for manhood in the larger duties of
a wider horizon. And, after all, are the
things for which we are striving in after
years any more worth while? Are they
always sweetened and uplifted by so much
devotion, unselfishness, loyalty, and singleness
of purpose? Are they thrilled by
as fine a spirit of manliness? We hear it
said that the old Yale spirit is losing its
savor, that men are working for themselves
rather than for the college, that they
hold in light esteem things that were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
sacred and vital to us. I do not believe
these criticisms are true.</p>

<p>"The young man I wished most to see
is not here to-night. He would not come
to help us celebrate a victory over an
ancient and honorable foe. He believes
that he has lost the respect of his comrades
and that he has been proven a failure.
For three years he has been a University
oar. This season he could not keep his
weight down to the limit of former years,
he found that he could not keep up with
the eight&mdash;although he tried as never before&mdash;and
he was not helping the crew.
The day came when he had to be removed,
and he experienced as bitter disappointment
as could befall a young man of spirit
and pluck. The coaches and captain expected
that he would throw up training,
leave the Quarters and go home. It was
the natural thing to do, because he was
cut to the soul, and it was like attending
his own funeral services to hang around
the place.</p>

<p>"Without a word he slipped into the
place of a substitute, and did a substitute's
work as long as there was need of it. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
venture to say that he would have scrubbed
out the boathouse if it would have been of
service to the crew. Do you know why
he took this stand? Not because he did
not care, but because he cared so much.
When he offered to help as a substitute
he said:</p>

<p>"'If I can help the Yale shell to go
faster by being out of it, I am glad of it.
That is what I am rowing for. And if I
can be of any use as a substitute, why, that
is what I am here for, too. It is all for
Yale, isn't it?'</p>

<p>"He did not know that he was overheard.
It was not meant to be overheard.
But it expressed his whole attitude, and
he stood by it to the end. You youngsters
who licked Harvard to-day deserve all the
praise and rejoicing that comes to you.
We are all proud of you, and we know
how hard and well you have worked. But
while you are the heroes of this celebration,
<i>the</i> hero did not row with you. His
name is 'Jack' Hastings, the man who
was glad to help a Yale crew go faster
by getting out of it.</p>

<p>"And when you hear it said that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Yale spirit is dying out, I want you to
think of that remark. That man absorbed
the spirit right here that made him take
that view as a matter of course. It was
because he did not think of anything else
to be done under the circumstances that
he epitomized the spirit that will make this
old place great as long as it stands. Endowments
and imposing buildings can
never breed that spirit. It grows and
blossoms as the fruitage of many generations
of tradition, and when Yale loses it,
she is become an empty shell, a diploma
factory, and no longer a nursery of the
right kind of manhood needed in this
country.</p>

<p>"Three long cheers for 'Jack' Hastings,
who, if he did not help to win this
race, will help to win races long after he
is gone from the campus world; and so
long as his words are remembered Yale
men on football field, on track and diamond,
and on the dear old Thames will
feel their inspiration. Are you ready?"</p>

<p>The men rose the length of the table
and shouted, with napkins waved on high.
Before the last "rah, rah, rah, Hastings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Hastings, Hastings," subsided, the Assistant
Manager had become red in the
face and exceedingly uneasy. He wrestled
with a weighty ethical problem, because
while he had pledged his word not
to reveal the secret of Hastings' presence
within sight and sound of this ovation, he
realized that to lead him in would be a
crowning and dramatic episode. A compromise
was possible, however, and he
slipped around the table and whispered
in the ear of "Big Bill" Hall.</p>

<p>In the gallery the little mother had
shrunk farther back into the shadows, half
afraid of this uproar, yet happier than
ever before in her life. She looked at her
boy, sitting close beside her, his face hidden
so that she could not see the illuminating
joy in it, the dazed look of unreality,
as if he were coming through dreamland.
There was no surprise in her mind. Of
course, this triumph was no more than
what was due, and she could have hugged
the massive chairman as a person of excellent
discernment. The boy whispered:</p>

<p>"He does not really mean it, Mother.
There is some mistake. He has been out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of college so long that he does not know
what things mean."</p>

<p>She patted his burning cheek and whispered:</p>

<p>"Why, I knew it all the time. But you
would not believe it if your mother said
you were a hero. I wonder how the Head
Coach feels now? I wish I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a quick leap Jack had wrenched
himself away and was clattering down the
stairs. He had seen the whispered conference
and "Big Bill" Hall staring up at
the gallery, and fearing that he was
trapped and betrayed, he fled into the
street and was running for the nearest
corner before the Assistant Manager
could pass through the hall to the foot
of the stairs. The conspirator had not
promised silence regarding Hastings'
mother, and before she knew what was
happening he was by her side, so quickly
that she thought it was Jack returned to
her. As she looked up in alarm, the Assistant
Manager had her reluctant hand,
and was insisting upon leading her to the
railing of the little gallery. She gazed
at the upturned faces, and there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
moment of expectant silence. Then
Judge Hall shouted the command:
"Three long cheers for Jack Hastings'
mother."</p>

<p>She was trembling now, and the lights
and faces below swam in a mist of tears,
as she timidly bowed. Then, as the full
realization of the tribute swept over her
like an engulfing wave, she became youthfully
erect, she smiled, and blew kisses
with both her slender hands toward the
long table. She was thanking them in
behalf of her boy, that was all, because
they too understood. Certain that he
must be waiting not far away, she bowed
again, and hurried down the stairs, meeting
the Head Coach in the hall. His face
was serious, his manner abashed, as he
said:</p>

<p>"I want to ask whether you will shake
hands with me, Mrs. Hastings. I am
proud that you do me the honor. I wish
to tell you something more than you have
heard to-night, and I am going to tell it
to all the men, when I return to the room.
Your son was too heavy to handle himself
as well as he did last year and the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
before. But I believe he would have
rowed in the race if a mistake had not
been made. I found out when it was too
late that his rigging, or measurements,
in the shell was not right for him, and it
would have made considerable difference
if he could have been shifted in time. It
was wholly my fault, and nobody else was
to blame in any way. I can never make
it up to him, and my only consolation is
that you have found what I have learned,
that he is a good deal finer man than we
thought him, and an honor to Yale beyond
all the rest of us. You must hate
me, more than any one else in the world.
I remember how my mother shared my
joys and sorrows in the crew."</p>

<p>The mother put out her hand again,
and clasped that of the Coach, as she said
simply, but with a catch of emotion in her
voice:</p>

<p>"I did hate you to-day. I thought you
had broken my boy's heart. Now I have
to thank you. God's ways are not our
ways, and I rejoice that while I have lost
a captain of the crew, I have gained a
man, every inch of him, tried in the fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and proven. This is the happiest night
of my life. I would rather have heard the
speech of Judge Hall, and the cheers that
followed it, than to have my son in four
winning crews and captain of every one
of them. Of course he is a hero. Didn't
you know that?"</p>

<p>The Head Coach started to speak, when
the elbow of "Big Bill" Hall nudged
him. The bulk of him filled the passage-way,
and his voice boomed out into
the night:</p>

<p>"If you don't bring that boy around to
the hotel to see me in the morning, I will
take back all I have said about him, Mrs.
Hastings. Now I know where he gets all
his fine qualities."</p>

<p>She blushed and courtesied, and the two
men escorted her to the pavement, as John
Hastings slipped from a doorway across
the street and came over to them. His
mother's escort, believing that he had been
no nearer the banquet than this, made a
rush for him, which he nimbly dodged,
and slipped his mother's arm in his.</p>

<p>"He is mine now," said she. "He has
a previous engagement, and, besides, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
don't want him spoiled. Good-night to
you. Come along, Jack, you are not too
big to mind your mother, are you?"</p>

<p>The two walked slowly across the
Green toward the campus. The communion
of their uplifted souls was perfect,
their happiness almost beyond words.
She was first to break this rare, sweet
silence, and strangely enough, she said
nothing about the vindication and the triumph.
Looking up into his face she
almost whispered:</p>

<p>"Are you caring so much that Cynthia
disappointed you to-day, dear boy of
mine? Does it hurt and rankle? I could
see it in your eyes to-night. Do you want
to marry her very much? Are you sure of
your heart?"</p>

<p>He winced a little and held her arm
tighter than before, as he replied:</p>

<p>"Little Mother, it has been my first real
love story, as you know. The thought of
her has helped me over many a rough
place. Before to-day she was always so
quick to understand. And&mdash;and she
seemed to like me better than any other
fellow she knew. I was fairly aching to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
be worthy of her, to make my place in the
world for her. I wasn't conceited enough
to think she loved me. I was only hoping
that some day&mdash;Any man has a right
to do that, has he not?"</p>

<p>It was not easy for the mother to say
what she wished to tell him, but at length
her response was:</p>

<p>"I don't want you to think I am criticising
her, or sitting in judgment, but
you must not let her mar your faith and
hope and happiness. I want to help you
to guard those precious gifts. You must
not blame her too much. You have been
believing that she understood you, because
you would have it that way. She is no
older than you, a girl of twenty, accustomed
to a wholly different life from
yours. She was flattered by your attention,
for you were a great man in her eyes.
She liked you because no one can help
liking you. But it made a difference
when you were a hero knocked off his
pedestal. And yet you expected to find
in her sympathy a balm that even your
mother could not give. Poor lad, mothers
are handy sometimes, but most boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
do not find it out until their mothers are
gone from them."</p>

<p>"I thought I knew her so well," said he,
after another silence. "It looks as if I
had amused her and nothing more. But
I have found you, and I have fallen head
over heels in love with you, Little Mother,
all over again, and I am going to kiss you
right under this electric light."</p>

<p>Even yet she was not sure that she had
sounded the depths of the ache in his
heart, but as she looked up at the light in
his campus rooms she said softly:</p>

<p>"Some day you will understand, and
will thank God your mother understood.
He giveth you the victory unforeseen."</p>

<h2 id="DESERTER">CORPORAL SWEENEY, DESERTER</h2></div>


<p>"I'll be gettin' five years&mdash;five years
at least."</p>

<p>The surging fear became fixed in
these words, and they, in turn, swung in
with the cadenced tramp of Corporal
Sweeney, the other prisoner, the sentry,
and the young lieutenant along the Chien-men
Road toward the American camp
and the guard-house. As the refrain
rolled itself over in the brain of the corporal,
he discovered that he was muttering
it aloud when the other prisoner said
explosively:</p>

<p>"I know you will, and so will I; but, by
----, I'm going to make a run for it!"</p>

<p>"You're the silliest fool in Peking if
you do," replied the corporal. "An'
where would you be after runnin' to? No
place to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He checked himself and turned his
head. The sentry and the lieutenant were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
at their heels, but in the clamor of the
crowded thoroughfare the talk had been
unheard. A swirl of Chinese street merchants
was scattering from in front of a
German wagon-train, a troop of Bengal
Lancers clattered recklessly into the ruck,
and the road flung the tangled traffic to
and fro between its walls, like a tide in a
mill-race. The corporal muttered again
to the scowling man beside him:</p>

<p>"Nothin' doin'. Sure to be captured
this side Tientsin. Forget it. You're
crazier than thim&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A shout in his ear made him jump aside,
and he saw the sentry lurch against the
flank of a transport camel and lose his
footing as a cart-wheel struck him from
behind. The loaded rifle fell on the chaotic
stone flagging. The other prisoner
heard the crash and knew what it meant.
Here seemed the chance he sought, but
instead of doubling into one of the
crooked side streets, he broke away down
the middle of the Chien-men Road, and
the traffic opened up for him, as the
crowd, grasping as by instinct what was
happening, scattered in panic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
The young lieutenant whipped his revolver
from its holster and took a snap-shot
at thirty yards, not caring overmuch
if a Chinese got in range of the heavy
bullet. As he fired, the fugitive seemed
to trip and catch himself, then ran a few
steps farther, falling all the time, until he
crumpled up in the filthy mud of the
pavement. The lieutenant stood looking
at his quarry, his eye still ranging along
the barrel of the revolver, while the sentry
had picked up his muddy rifle, and, feeling
faint and shaky, watched a private of
his own regiment become, in an instant,
something that looked like a roll of blankets
doubled under the feet of the Chinese
street mob.</p>

<p>The two had forgotten the corporal,
who stood beside them as intent as they
upon the pitiable tragedy; and the three
appeared to be posing for a military tableau.
But almost as swiftly as death had
come to the escaping prisoner, there swept
over the one that remained a frenzy of
desire to run. He knew how remote was
the possibility of freedom, how desperately
small the chance against recapture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
dead or alive. But hammers were beating
in his head the cadence of "I'll be gettin'
five years&mdash;five years at least." And the
opportunity was made by another's unwilling
sacrifice.</p>

<div class="figcenter2em" id="i118"><img src="images/i118.jpg" width="400"
height="695" alt="" title="" />
<div class="caption">
<i>The flight of Corporal Sweeney.</i></div></div>


<p class="p2">The corporal was unconscious of a voluntary
act, and something seemed swiftly
to drag him, as he wheeled and dashed
for the entrance of an alley not more than
ten yards away. A peddler's shoulder-yoke
was splintered against his shoulder,
and he thought that the bruising impact
was the shock of the expected bullet; the
yells of the sweetmeat-sellers at the alley's
mouth sounded like the outcry he dreaded
to hear; but the lieutenant and the sentry
turned in time to see only the trail of
sprawling Chinese left in the wake of the
escaping prisoner. The sentry jumped
in pursuit, stumbled into the tortuous
alley, and saw a blank wall ahead. Between
that and the Chien-men Road three
lanes twisted off to left and right, and he
ran up the nearest one at random.</p>

<p>Somewhere beyond the huddled houses,
he could hear the thud of leather-shod
feet, the staccato flight of which marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the trail of the deserter; but the pursuer
could find no way through or around.
When he entered the street beyond, there
was no blue overcoat in the crowded field
of vision, and the shuffling sound of felt-soled
native shoes gave no clew. He returned
to the lieutenant, genuinely weary
and speciously disappointed. The officer
was leaning over the body of the other
prisoner, and there was keen unhappiness
in his flushed young face.</p>

<p>"I've found an empty cart," he said to
the sentry. "Help me carry this poor
fellow to camp. He has no use for a
doctor. As for Sweeney, he can't get
away. He's hiding in the American section,
and I will get the provost-marshal
over the field 'phone from headquarters,
and have the guard sweep the district
from end to end. The man will be captured
before morning."</p>

<p>This occurred to the fugitive, also, as
certain to happen, when he staggered
through a little courtyard, far in the heart
of the "Chinese City," and fell into a corner
of a smoke-fogged room. It was so
nearly nightfall that the one occupant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
failing to recognize the headlong visitor,
yelled and scuttled away from the brazier
which he was trying to coax into warmth
against the winter night.</p>

<p>"It's me&mdash;all same me&mdash;come back.
You no sabee this American soldier if
men come to look see me," gasped the corporal.</p>

<p>The Chinaman nodded without speaking
and slipped out. Sweeney was fighting
for breath, and the fumes of coal-gas
in the fetid room were suffocating him.
He tore a hole in the side wall of oiled
paper, and gulped his lungs full of the
frosty night air. It was the room from
which he had gone the day before, when,
after drinking much Japanese beer, he
had bought a quart of <i>samshu</i> to carry
away with him.</p>

<p>It was the deadly, maddening samshu
that had caused the downfall of Corporal
Sweeney, and now he was trying to remember
what had happened in the twenty-four
hours before he had been marched
down the Chien-men Road with the other
prisoner. He knew that he had overstayed
his leave, but that was a minor matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
compared with the row in the canteen on
Legation Street. He recalled that an
American officer had entered the place to
investigate the uproar, and the corporal's
mind held a blurred picture of himself
conspicuously cursing his superior officer
with black oaths, and struggling to
"knock the face off him." Then he had
fled, to be picked up later by the lieutenant
who had shot and killed Private
Smathers on the way to camp.</p>

<p>The corporal drew back from the hole
in the paper wall, and slumped down on
the floor, a Chinese blue blouse tucked
under his aching head.</p>

<p>"An' five years more, for attempted
escape," he groaned, "an' two clane enlistments
behind me, an' promotion a cinch
in the next six months. Never a coort
martial ag'in' me. It was all the &mdash;&mdash;
samshu. Serves a white man right for
foolin' with haythen liquor. An' they'll
be pullin' me out of here in no time at all.
Holy Mother! where kin I go?"</p>

<p>The disgraced soldier turned as a new
dread smote him.</p>

<p>"An' the Boxer swine that kapes this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
poison-shop will be handin' me over as
soon as he hears the news of the shindy
down the Chien-men Road."</p>

<p>Panic fear caught hold of the corporal,
body and soul, and he wrestled with it in
the darkness. He knew not whither to
turn. Hiding among the Chinese in the
city was impossible, and to take to the
open road meant capture at Tientsin or
Taku if he made his way that far in a
flight toward the seacoast. To go blindly
into the country about Peking, unarmed
and penniless as he was, knowing perhaps
five words of Chinese, was to drag out the
finish in slow starvation, or to be picked
up by a foreign outpost, or to fall among
hostile natives. He was as helpless as a
castaway adrift on a raft in mid-ocean.
The penalties of capture or surrender
seemed worse than any sort of death, for
Corporal Sweeney had been a good soldier,
bred to a hardy outdoor life.</p>

<p>The disgrace tortured him, and either
alternative of his situation was unthinkable.
Yet after three hours of trembling
in his trap, he would have welcomed the
chance of flight into the open, beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
walls of the nightmare city. The Chinese
landlord had not returned, and it seemed
likely that intruders had been warned
away from the smoky room with the hole
in the oiled paper of the side wall. The
deserter had found a bottle of samshu,
and tried to brace his nerves with a swallow
of it, but the smell sickened him, and
he flung it against the brick partition, in
a passion of rage at the source of his cyclonic
ruin. The heavy, yellow liquid
guttered across the floor, and the stench
of it drove the soldier into the courtyard,
where the chatter of Chinese voices sent
him quaking back into his little inferno.</p>

<p>He was not a coward, but he was alone
in the darkness with such fears as wrested
from him all weapons. Somewhere outside,
a Chinese watchman, drifting along
on his rounds, was beating a gong to
frighten away evil-doers. The measured
<i>bong, bong, bong</i> caused the fugitive
to wish that sudden death might overtake
the harmless old gentleman, for at each
stroke it seemed as if tacks were being
driven into his skull. Toward midnight
Corporal Sweeney fell into a stupor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
complete exhaustion that was no more
than a caricature of sleep. A scratching
on the paper door and a falsetto whisper
awoke him, and he sprang to his feet,
striking out in the gloom, to ram his fist
through the fragile panel into something
yielding which cried:</p>

<p>"O-w-w&mdash;a-i-i! Me, master; You Han.
Somet'ing do-ing, all l-l-ight?"</p>

<p>The deserter extended a muscular arm,
grasped a handful of wadded coat, and
dragged the visitor in with one lightning
sweep. Then, trying to choke his amazed
voice into a whisper, he croaked:</p>

<p>"Oh, me cock-eyed darlin' lad! An'
how did you dig me out? I niver felt like
kissin' a Chink before. Now get me out o'
this, or I'll break your back over me two
knees. I'm down an' out this time. Are
you goin' to give me up for the sake o'
the rewarrd?"</p>

<p>The boy, whom the corporal had picked
up, a starving outcast from a plundered
village, on the march to Peking, tried to
tell what he knew in painfully Pidgin
English, shattered by his master's interruptions.
He had learned that the cor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>poral
was a day overdue in camp, and had
started out to find him early that morning.
Then came the tragedy and the escape,
the tidings of which were brought
to the camp with the body of Private
Smathers. You Han had heard the name
"Sweeney" scattered through the excited
talk of the company, until he pieced together
a working impression of what had
happened. He had ransacked canteens,
tea-houses and gambling-dens from the
camp to the Tatar city wall until he began
to pick up the trail from groups at
the street corners who had seen the "madman
runaway soldier."</p>

<p>The corporal chopped the narrative
short, because he was not interested in
the way of his fall into the bottomless pit,
but in an agony of speculation regarding
the new possibility of a way out. The
coming of You Han made him clutch the
hope of the open country, anywhere, anyhow,
no matter what lay beyond. The
thought of flight alone among the millions
of mysterious aliens had oppressed him
horribly. You Han had the fidelity of a
dog for the domineering American sol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>dier,
whose ways he did not understand,
but, because they were his ways, they were
believed to be impeccable. Now his lord
had done something more extraordinary
than usual, for which, it appeared, decapitation
threatened. In addition to blind
obedience, You Han knew what samshu
was, and was ready to make large allowances.
It was only this new tone of
entreaty, almost of supplication, that
alarmed the servant. Corporal Sweeney
shook off the paralyzing grip of his fears
long enough to give You Han orders in
a voice that still quavered in little broken
gasps:</p>

<p>"You get Peking cart, quick? Qui-qui&mdash;chop-chop&mdash;chase
yourself&mdash;sabee?
Have you got any money in thim flowin'
robes?"</p>

<p>You Han flashed a bisecting grin that
was like splitting a sheet of parchment,
and dove into a knotted sash, where the
clink of silver made reply. Then he was
gone, and the deserter became instantly
submerged in the returning rush of his
manifold terrors. It seemed years before
he heard the protesting shrieks of a cart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
axle and the rattle of harness in the compound.
You Han stole in, and half
dragging the corporal to the cart, helped
him to crawl under the curtained hood,
whispering:</p>

<p>"One piecee cart belong my cousin. No
pay him. You stay bottom side. We go
countlee."</p>

<p>As the cart jolted into the alley, the
man beneath the cover heard, faint and
far, the beat of cavalry hoofs on the
frozen earth. They were coming nearer,
and the fugitive flattened himself under
a pile of quilts, while the sweat beaded on
his face. In a few moments the clink of
sabers and the creaking of saddle-leathers
were audible, and the patrol wheeled into
a side street so close to the jogging cart
that the deserter caught the voice of a
Sixth Cavalry trooper objecting:</p>

<p>"It's a blazin' cold night to be pokin'
in all the rat-holes of Peking for as good
a blank-blanked son of a gun as Jack
Sweeney. Wonder how he got up against
it so hard."</p>

<p>The reply was lost, for the deserter's
heart was whanging against his ribs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
sounding louder to him than the clatter of
cavalry. You Han drove the mule at a
gallop and said no word except once,
when he turned and remarked:</p>

<p>"Samshu no good, master. Floget it.
Dlink water, all l-l-ight."</p>

<p>At daylight the cart was beyond the
outer wall of Peking, heading west, as
aimless a derelict as ever tossed in uncharted
seas. You Han did not veer toward
his own home on the Pei-ho, for he
knew that it lay in the track of the traffic
to Tientsin, and that over the ruins of his
village floated the flag of an American
infantry outpost. The dawn came clear
and cold, but sad in the gray aspect of
tenantless villages, and the litter of ungarnered
millet-fields stretching over the
flat lands to the horizon. The driver told
the deserter that the last foreign outpost
had been passed, and that he might get
out and walk with safety. Half frozen,
bitterly bruised from tossing between
floor and roof of the springless cart, hungry
and weak, the deserter climbed from
his ignominious hiding-place and trudged
in silence along the rutted highway. Pres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>ently
You Han turned off the road,
threaded a course through the yards of a
shattered temple, and drew up by a marble
altar.</p>

<p>"Have chow now," said he, and the
summons to breakfast aroused a shadow
of animation in the deserter. He knew
not where the meal was coming from, but
he was past wondering, and the Chinese
youth was in full command of the sorry
expedition. You Han crawled into the
cart and produced a charcoal stove, dried
fish, potatoes, and a teapot.</p>

<p>"All belong my cousin. He keep store;
pay bimeby," said the boy, with what
might have passed for a wink.</p>

<p>The companions ate in silence. Shame
had begun to march in the foreground of
the deserter's thoughts, crowding fear a
little to the rear. The soldier of a conquering
race was as helpless as a child in
the hands of one of the conquered whom
he had not considered wholly human,
whose swarms had fled like rats before the
path of the columns in khaki. The fugitive
cursed and hated himself, possessed
by an unmanly humiliation impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
imagine a few hours before. The little
dun mule munched dry millet-stalks, and
squealed when You Han fetched him
water from the temple well.</p>

<p>"I ain't got as much sand left in me
as that sawed-off apology fer a mule,"
groaned the corporal; "an' he's a good
deal more of a man than meself."</p>

<p>You Han resumed the march without
consulting his lord, which made the deserter
writhe anew, but he could say nothing.
The cart trailed along the foot of
an ancient military wall for several miles,
while the man sullenly chewed the cud of
bitterness and the boy revolved great
things in his unruffled mind. You Han
was about to venture on some fragmentary
consolation, when the deserter, who
was walking a little in advance, balked
in his tracks and stood crouched as if he
had seen a rattlesnake. The dun mule
snorted and fanned his ears like an agitated
jack-rabbit. A furlong beyond, the
steel ribbons of a railway track cut across
the road and vanished in sandy cuttings.
Corporal Sweeney looked instinctively
for a telegraph line and saw one wire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
threading the skyline in a humming loop.
The sight hurled him back to the Chien-men
Road and the lieutenant alertly picking
off Private Smathers with a long
snap-shot.</p>

<p>"What's this fool railroad doin' here?
I wonder are they consthructin' it to ketch
up with me? Come a-runnin' there
<i>pronto</i>,<sup>[A]</sup> chop-chop. Ain't there no gettin'
away from annywhere?"</p>


<p class="p2 i7">[A] Soldiers who have campaigned in the Philippines use
the word <i>pronto</i> for "hurry up" or "hustle."</p>

<p class="p2">He volleyed the questions at You Han
as if they had been jerked out of him.
The boy looked puzzled as he replied:</p>

<p>"Devil cart go Pao-ting-fu, then go
Peking. No belong to Amelican soldier.
English have got."</p>

<p>They crossed the rails on the run, as if
the metals burned their feet, and the deserter
flogged the mule into a gallop, until
their road twisted beyond sight of the
track and its unexpected autograph of a
civilization they were fleeing headlong.
He would not have dared predict it, but
in the afternoon Corporal Sweeney began
to be a man again. They had passed be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>yond
the area laid waste by the Christian
allies, and the villages were populous and
busy. You Han had glimpsed a shadow
of the shame that smoldered in his master's
mind, and he was for making little
overtures, simple yet crafty, to win him
back to himself. As the first step in reconstruction,
he called "Look-see, master!"
and pulled from beneath the body of the
cart a "Krag" rifle, bayonet, and cartridge-belt.
The deserter threw back his
shoulders at sight of them, and in an outburst
of gratitude smote his benefactor so
that his head ached for several hours.</p>

<p>"Last night, when get cart, go back
camp," twittered You Han; "find one
piecee master's gun in tent. Plenty dark.
Sently shoot, no can hit. Good, by golly!"</p>

<p>"Good! you twenty-four carat jewel of
Asia! You're the goodest imitation of a
white man that was ever bound in yeller
leather by mistake. Now I feel as if I
wanst looked like a man meself. Give me
a rag an' a bit o' that stinkin' cookin'-grease,
an' make room on the carrt till I
do up me house-cleanin'."</p>

<p>You Han grinned and began to wail an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
interminable song about a girl called
"Little Fat Spring Fragrance," who
lived in the "Village of the Wise and
Benevolent Magistrate." The ballad rose
shriller as the singer saw the corporal
swinging along ahead, his rifle nestling
on his squared shoulder as if it had come
home to its own, his back as flat as a board.
You Han was even more jubilant when
his master spun on his heel, and shouted
with the rasp of the drill-ground in his
voice:</p>

<p>"Shut up that racket! It's worse 'n the
carrt axle."</p>

<p>The bracing wind swept keen out of the
Siberian north, and sunshine flooded from
a cloudless sky. The deserter forgot much
of his weariness, and caught himself whistling
"assembly," but broke off with a
groan.</p>

<p>Toward sunset the surrounding wall of
a village was outlined like a rocky island
in the level plain. You Han halted a
ragged wayfarer, and coaxingly addressing
him as "great elder brother," dragged
forth the information that the town was
of considerable size, and that in it was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
residence of the ruler of the district. The
song of the "Village of the Wise and
Benevolent Magistrate" had suggested
an inspiration whose magnitude made
You Han gasp. But he took possession
of it without flinching, and when they
were within a mile of the gateway in the
wall he said to the deserter:</p>

<p>"You wait. I go look-see."</p>

<p>The mule browsed by the roadside, the
corporal sprawled near by, and the brave
figure in blue cotton trudged on alone to
the town, the strangeness of which made
his heart flutter. He swaggered in past
the outer wall, searched out the <i>yamen</i> of
the district magistrate, and that dignitary
graciously consented to see the importunate
pilgrim. You Han kotowed before
the heart-quaking presence in the gilded
audience-room, and with wailing stammer
delivered the oration composed on the
cart:</p>

<p>"An illustrious and most honorable
general of the foreign soldiers comes to
visit your beautiful city. I am his insignificant
and thrice-despised servant. This
valiant and inexpressibly distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
hero is of the Americans, who protect and
do not plunder and destroy. He comes
to extend peace and protecting power to
your Heavenly Presence, and to learn
whether you have been molested by other
foreign-devil armies, whom he will swiftly
punish if it be your august pleasure to
ask it. My insufferably benevolent master
leaves soldiers, cannon, horses behind
him, lest he terrify the country round
about, already in fear of the devastating
foreign fighting-men. He sends the greetings
of one ruler to another, and also his
card."</p>

<p>You Han bobbed his head to the floor
by way of incessant punctuation, and
watching eagerly from the tail of his eye
for results hopeful or otherwise, laid before
the magistrate the vivid label of a tin
of "Army Cut Plug," on which heroes in
blue and khaki posed nonchalantly in a
"baptism of fire." A group of official
servants, crowding within ear-shot, saw
a gleam of surprised pleasure twinkle
through the huge spectacles of their ruler.
They took their cue, and helping the
trembling You Han to his feet, were soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
bustling through the courtyard, propelled
by vehement commands to make haste.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, the deserter saw approaching
a procession led by You Han
and a squad of yamen runners, whom he
knew by the red tassels on their flat hats.
These rode shaggy rats of ponies, and behind
them tailed off scores of villagers on
foot and convoys of squealing children.
The American grabbed his rifle and
dodged behind the cart, ready to run or
open fire, until he heard You Han's shrill
shouts of reassurance. Then he was
swept up in an admiring throng, whose
bodies doubled in homage, down to the
wee tots who fell on their flat noses when
they tried to kotow.</p>

<p>You Han had no time for explanations.
He was expanding in the reflected glory
of his own devising, and busy chasing children
from under the agile hoofs of the
ponies. In their layers of wadded coats,
like so many puff balls, the jolly youngsters
rolled to the roadside, and the deserter
felt a stir of emotion which he could
not have defined. Yes, there were homes
and firesides and mothers and play and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
work and love in this land of desolation,
and the smoke of the village hearths beckoned
with vague homeliness.</p>

<p>The shopkeepers left their wares and
the old men in the doorways tucked away
their pipes when the procession filled the
little streets, and the deserter rode to
the yamen like a conquering hero. In the
courtyard of the compound other servants
waited to escort the "benevolent foreign
general" to rooms made ready for him.
There was fire in the brick <i>kang</i>, or sleeping-platform,
and chickens, eggs, fruit
and potatoes, and a fur-lined robe were
heaped on a table. You Han vanished, and
the outlaw sat himself down in speechless
wonderment. Presently You Han returned
and announced that the magistrate
would be inexpressibly honored to receive
the Personage in the evening, and the
reason for not inviting him to dine was
that he knew the guest would prefer his
food prepared after his own strange
fashion by his own servant. As in a gorgeous
dream the deserter dined, with three
attendants squabbling with You Han for
the honor of passing each dish. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
brushed his dusty leggings and blue
clothes and summoned a barber.</p>

<p>A little later the guest was greeted as a
person of rare distinction by the dignified
elderly gentleman in red-silk robes who
ruled and "squeezed" the district. The
corporal rose grandly to the occasion.
The two mingled to a nicety their mutual
attitudes of respect, cordiality, protection.
They talked laboriously through the
doubtful medium of the overpowered
You Han, whom the intricacies of the
mandarin dialect bowled over from the
one side, and on the other such instructions
as these from the corporal:</p>

<p>"Tell old Four-Eyes that I'm the personal
ripresintative of George Washington
and Gineral Grant, an' that when I
stamp me fut a million brave soldiers
trimble violently; but that because I know
a great intelleck when I see one, me heart
is swelled with pride to sit down and talk
it over as man to man. Poke that into him
good and har-r-d."</p>

<p>The official volleyed many questions,
and the deserter parried what fragments
of them You Han was able to pass along.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
A military escort to the next village was
offered, but the guest declined with polite
emphasis. He was not seeking ostentation
in public. When he went to his apartments
after a surfeit of cakes, wine, and
tobacco, Corporal John Sweeney rubbed
his close-cropped head and puzzled over
his identity. As he curled up on the
warm brick kang, he was a deserter fast
becoming reconciled to his fate.</p>

<p>"It strains the rivets of me imagination
to believe it's rale. I hope there's more
miracles in stock where this one was projuced,"
he murmured sleepily.</p>

<p>Just at dawn he awoke. There was a
clatter of voices in the courtyard, and the
sound of horses moving hurriedly. Presently
the paper of the latticed wall was
ripped, and a brown finger popped
through. All the fears of the refugee
came trooping back with squadrons reinforced.
He ripped the door open, rifle
in hand. A string of traders' ponies was
filing out for an early start toward Peking,
and a hostler stood with his face
pressed against the hole in the wall, trying
to catch a glimpse of the lordly for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>eigner.
That was all. But the deserter
saw again the smoky room in the "Chinese
City," and heard the Sixth Cavalry squad
wheel just in rear of his frantic flight.
The "illustrious guest" was again the
fugitive, escaping, he knew not whither,
from "five years&mdash;five years at least."</p>

<p>He kicked the sleeping You Han into
action, and the cart was under way as soon
as the mule had fed.</p>

<p>"Only thirty miles from Peking,"
growled the corporal; "not half far
enough. An' cavalry is prancin' out to
loot, pacify, an' scatter Christian blessings
with th' mailed fisht where they have
no business to be thinkin' of. I hike till
I drop, an' that's me ultimatum."</p>

<p>They pressed on all day until the dun
mule swayed in the shafts and the pilgrims
were ready to drop by the roadside.
The night was passed in a village tavern,
for You Han was too weary to organize
a reception. The deserter slept fitfully,
and awoke often talking to himself.
Nervous and foot-sore, he took the trail at
dawn of the third day, You Han watchful
and worried. As the deserter turned fre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>quently
to look behind him, the aspect of
the future crushed him, while the imminent
past lashed him to persistent flight.
Camp, and the close comradeship of men
in blue and khaki; the routine round of his
army years; the Chicago streets that had
known his boyhood; the father and mother
who were proud of his record&mdash;these and
all other links in the chain of his thirty
years were as if they had never been
forged. Names, faces and scenes of which
he had been an intimate part were in an
obliterating distance, and nothing that had
gone before was given strength to follow
him, except the incidents of his escape,
and these filled all the landscape with portents.</p>

<p>Soon they came to a schoolhouse in the
middle of a tiny hamlet. You Han knew
it for such when the refugees were rods
away, since from the squat building came
an incessant sound like the hum of a
gigantic top. The children were reciting
their daily task from the Confucian Analects
at the limit of their lung power, when
the foreigner was spied by a truant outpost,
and the teacher could not hold the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
clamorous flock in leash. By scores they
tumbled out to scamper off in terror until
You Han shouted his message of good
will and the corporal laughed, threw down
his rifle, and became one of them. It was
not long before uproarious applause
greeted his attempts to play jackstones
and strike the sharpened stick to make
it fly into the miniature mud-pie "city."</p>

<p>Again the feeling of homeliness tugged
at his heart, and he lingered among the
children until the teacher gathered them
in, with labor like that of collecting spilled
quicksilver.</p>

<p>You Han swaggered into the next village
beyond, with a port inspired by remembrance
of the magistrate's yamen, but
he came to grief at the hands of the village
bully. There was no mistaking the character
of this truculent ruffian. His garments
were studiously awry, and his queue
was loosely braided and coiled around his
neck to show that he thirsted for combat.
He resented the lofty bearing of the
stranger, and the two clashed with disaster
to the features of You Han, who was
plucky but overmatched. He was rescued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
by the corporal, who gave the bully the
worst beating of his career. The feat was
applauded by a throng of villagers whose
peace had been much disturbed by this
chronic nuisance, and they feasted the
hero at the house of the head man with
complex and effusive hospitality. The
wayfarers were pressed to stay and make
the town their home for life.</p>

<p>This incident, coming in a sequence of
revelations of the life of this hitherto despised
people, set the thoughts of the
deserter definitely into a new and hopeful
channel.</p>

<p>"I begin to think," he said to You Han,
"that I could stick it out in one of these
back counties, at worst until the troops are
l'avin' China in the spring. An' I could
come pretty near to runnin' a town or two
meself. One more day's march an' I'll
risk stakin' out a claim for a while. An'
I'll be a leadin' an' dignified citizen, an'
grandfather by brevet to all the kids in
the camp."</p>

<p>The advance was checked by the discovery
that the cart axle had split and
must be repaired to prevent a breakdown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
over the next bit of rough going. The
corporal was in a bluster of impatience to
press forward. Delay had not lost its
power to frighten him. The next village
lay ten miles beyond, but between was a
desolate stretch of waste land in which no
one lived, in which nothing grew. From
the tiled roof of the tavern the corporal
could see this little desert rolling like a
lake almost from the village walls to the
sky line. It caught his fancy with a huge
onset of relief. Once beyond this barrier,
he would feel secure against discovery,
and he magnified it as the borderland of
safety. You Han was surrounded by a
group of voluble citizens who urged waiting
two days until a new axle could be
hewn from the solid tree; but the deserter
exploded the conference by shouting:</p>

<p>"Dump the carrt here. Pack the mule,
an' we'll send back for the Noah's ark
when we get settled over beyant. Make
haste an' upholster the mule with the baggage
of light marchin' order."</p>

<p>When the dun mule, in tow of the boy,
limped out of the gateway across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
crumbling moat, its small hoofs sank to
the fetlock in white sand, and the trail of
cart-wheels winding across the plain shimmered
in an aching dazzle of sunlight. At
the end of an hour the village behind them
was a brown smudge not more than two
miles distant. The deserter made peevish
comments, but there was cheerfulness in
the crack of his profanity, as he plodded
painfully ahead of the boy and the mule.
Whenever they paused to rest he talked
to You Han, not caring whether the boy
understood one word in five. The two
seemed alone in all the world; their calamitous
fortunes were more closely knit than
at any time in the flight; and hope lay
somewhere beyond this barricade provided
by a fate grown strangely kind.</p>

<p>"You'll have the next week to get the
sand out o' thim foolish shoes o' yourn,"
observed the corporal. "An' me blisters
will be attinded to by the chief surgeon of
the county. Like chickens an' silk over-coats,
my son? We're goin' hell-bent
for the comforts of life by the carrt-load."</p>

<p>You Han talked to the mule in encour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>aging
whistles and replied, "Can do," to
the monologue of the corporal, who rambled
on:</p>

<p>"Say, thim kids did me more good than
a barrel o' monkeys. Weren't they corkers?
By the holy poker! I'm goin' to
marry you off to a little squeeze-toed fairy
in the big town over the way, an' you'll
live without worrkin' forevermore. Maybe
the old man will follow suit. It's me
life ambition to be idle an' palatial. An'
You Han will be the hottest sport in fifty
li. Dinghowdy? All right?"</p>

<p>In the third hour they were not more
than halfway across, and the short winter
afternoon was reddening. The level desolation
had begun to tumble up into crowding
little hills and sand barriers among
which the trail now and then entangled
itself. But the air was crystal and windless,
and scrambling to the top of one of
the white hills, the corporal could see the
faintest tracery of a towered temple on
the farther side of the desert as a guiding
landmark. It was a forced march, and a
halt was made only for a fragment of supper
and a swig for man and mule from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the water-bottle on the pack. The moon
rose in the sleeping dusk, but before it was
clear of the scalloping ridges of sand the
sky became spattered with rags of flying
cloud. Presently the wind behind the
angry scud began to pick up gusts of
sand and flirt them from one crest to another.
The travelers rubbed their eyes
and coughed as they plowed steadily westward,
steering a course by the cart-trail,
still discernible, and by the moon behind
them. "We're more 'n halfway over,"
shouted the corporal, "an' it's silly to be
dr'amin' of losin' ourselves in this two-by-four
desert."</p>

<p>Then the gray sky closed down in blackness
everywhere, and leaping billows of
sand seemed to meet it. The rush of the
terrific wind wiped out the trail as if it
had been no more than a finger-mark.
There were no more hills nor winding passages
among them, only a fog of whirling
sand. The wind had an icy edge as it
brought the killing cold of Mongolian
steppes a thousand miles away. The deserter
and the boy covered their faces
with their hands, their garments; and al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>most
instantly they were adrift, cowering,
lost, helpless. So dense was the driving
smother of sand that they could scarcely
see the mule straining at the end of its
halter-rope. The hillocks were shifting
with a complaining roar, and the shriek of
the wind in mid-air was pierced with a
shrill rasp like the commotion of innumerable
iron filings.</p>

<p>The corporal and You Han groped
toward the side of a hillock, seeking a lee;
but the flooding sand tumbled down its
side knee-deep, and the wind sucked round
and searched them out, as if in chase. The
flinty particles pelted in sheets, and bit
their faces like incessant volleys of fine
shot. There was no more time to think of
what should be done than when a swimmer
is plunged over a dam.</p>

<p>It did not seem possible that the danger
of death was menacing in this absurdly
small theater of action, yet it could not
have been many moments before the deserter
began to realize where lay the odds
in another hour's exposure to such a storm.
All sense of direction had been snatched
from him, and he fought only for breath.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
You Han had no knowledge of desert
storms in his home on the bank of the Pei-ho.
He gasped whatever prayers came to
him, but placed his active faith, still unshaken,
in the ability of his master to save
him from the choking, freezing terror.
The man and the boy were not only stifled,
but soon benumbed, for neither had ever
felt anything to compare with the searching
cold of this blast. They stumbled
from one hill to another, sometimes keeping
their feet, falling oftener, rising more
slowly, the little mule trying in vain to
turn tail to the storm.</p>

<p>There could be no conversation. At
length the deserter muttered drowsily to
the storm such fragments as these:</p>

<p>"No place like home. It's the finish
that's comin' to me. Cudn't take me medicine
like a man. P'rhaps this'll blow
over soon. I'm blinded entirely. Good
God! forgive me poor cowardly sowl! I
niver meant to go wrong. Had to bring
that poor fool You Han into this mess."</p>

<p>The deserter pitched forward on hands
and knees, his rifle buried somewhere in
his circling wake. He caught hold of You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Han's queue lest they lose each other, and
then the mule pushed impetuously between
them, ears forward, muzzle outstretched,
trumpeting joyfully.</p>

<p>"He b'lieve can find. He sabee plenty,"
feebly sputtered You Han.</p>

<p>The frantic mule dragged the boy by
the lead-rope a few paces, the corporal
falling, sliding after, and then stopped.
The linked procession could go no farther.
You Han collapsed in a little heap, and
the corporal toppled face down. The boy
had tied the lead-rope around his own
wrist, and the impatient mule was jerking
it so that the forlorn figure in the sand
seemed to make appealing gestures. The
corporal was without motion, and with a
mighty effort You Han pulled himself a
little nearer, and the mule followed protestingly.
The swaying curtain of sand
closed in around the three figures.</p>

<p>You Han struggled to his knees and
with his teeth loosed the knotted cinch,
and the pack fell from the mule. The boy
writhed over on the corporal and tried to
raise the dead weight, tried to talk to him
in a wordless and appealing whimper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
The deserter strove to rise, and failed until
he dully comprehended that the boy
sought to make him mount the mule, or at
least to hitch him in tow with the lead-rope.
Then the soldier awoke, and fighting
off the death that had almost mastered
him, lurched to one knee and pushed You
Han toward the mule that was standing
over them. His voice thick and rasping
as if his tongue were of sandpaper, the
deserter succeeded in saying:</p>

<p>"Get aboard that mule. No Chinese
village in mine. Better man than me&mdash;you
an' mule both better men. You
won't? &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; you, take that!"</p>

<p>The deserter swung his fist against the
jaw of the struggling boy, and the blow
went home with the last flicker of the
old-time fighting strength of Corporal
Sweeney. You Han dropped limp, as if
shot. Then the fugitive from army justice
braced himself, tried, and failed to
lift the light body in his arms. Three
times he tried and failed, and then, as
the mule swerved, he fell against it and
dropped the lad across its back, like a
bundle of quilts. The cinch, trailing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the sand, tripped the man, and he slipped
it over You Han and pulled it tight before
he fell back in the tossing sand. The mule
stumbled a step or two with its burden,
found that it was free and in a moment
tottered beyond the vision of the deserter.</p>

<p>Not more than a hundred yards away a
camel-trail lay encamped against the
storm, and to the Mongolian drivers, huddled
in furs close to their beasts, came a
little dun mule half dragging an unconscious
Chinese youth, whom they took for
dead as they wonderingly cut him loose
from his lashing.</p>

<p>Daylight and the tail of the sand-storm
had come before he was able to speak, and
the camels were jostling into the line of
march. The swarthy drivers scoffed at
the story told by the raving stranger, until
the bell-camel shied at something
nearly buried in the sand. You Han
fought the greedy northerners off until
he had disclosed a figure in army blue and
a clean-cut Irish face whose expression
was vastly peaceful.</p>

<p>The last silver coin was gone from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
knotted sash of You Han after he had
persuaded the camel-men to carry the
body to the village where Corporal
Sweeney had expected to find a refuge
from fear.</p>

<h2 id="SCHOONER">THE LAST PILOT SCHOONER</h2></div>


<p>Young James Arbuthnot Wilson
slipped into the <i>Standard</i> building
with an uneasy air as if he were
vaguely on the defensive. Six months of
work in the "City Department" had not
rid him of the feeling of a cat in a strange
garret. The veterans of the staff were
rather pleased that this should be the attitude
common among young reporters. It
showed that the office machine was geared
to high tension when every man, short of
five years' service, was thankful to find
his "job" had not slid from under him
between two days.</p>

<p>Wilson could recall no specific warnings
that his head was in peril. His activities
had been too inconspicuous to
merit the dignity of official notice of any
kind. He had faithfully followed his
foot-sore round of minor police courts,
hospitals, one-alarm fires, and dreary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
public meetings, to have his copy jammed
as scanty paragraphs under the head of
"City Jottings." A "story" filling a
third of a column had marked his one red-letter
day on the <i>Standard</i>.</p>

<p>Each afternoon, at one o'clock, he hurried
to his pigeon-hole in the row of letter-boxes
by the city editor's door, his heart
thumping to this sense of intangible fear,
and with it pulsing the foolish hope of a
"big assignment." Some day they must
give him a chance, and he would show
them whether or not he could handle
something worth while. But the flame of
hope was low on this dull day of June as
Wilson unlocked his box and tore open
the yellow envelope on which his name
was scrawled.</p>

<p>He whistled in blank amazement as he
followed an unfamiliar hand down to the
managing editor's signature. The youngster's
face flushed and his fingers twittered
as he turned sharply to see if the loungers
at their desks had noted his agitation.
Then he stole into the hall and re-read,
with his lips moving as if he were spelling
out the words:</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>



<p class="p2 i2"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Wilson</span>: You have been
pegging away without any let-up for
three months and your work has been excellent.
Here is an easy assignment as a
reward of merit. It will give you a pleasant
outing, and us a good page story for
the Sunday sheet. The enclosed clipping
from to-day's paper will give you the
idea. The art department will have a
snap-shot camera waiting for you. Our
Ship-News man made arrangements this
morning for you to be met and taken
aboard. The one-forty train from Broad
Street Station will take you through to
Lewes and the Breakwater. To save
time I enclose some expense money.
Try to be back on Thursday. This will
give you three days at sea. We want
plenty of rattling description and human
interest, with local color <i>ad lib.</i> Good
luck.</p>

<p class="p2">"Oh, there must be some mistake,"
gasped young Wilson. "A page Sunday
story? A whole page? My work has
been excellent? The managing editor
has been following it? Why, I didn't
suppose he knew me by sight. I can't
believe it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Befogged with hopes and fears, he
turned back to the door of the city editor's
room.</p>

<p>"He's just gone out to lunch with the
managing editor," volunteered the day
assistant. "No, I don't know where they
went. Said they'd be back about two-thirty."</p>

<p>Wilson looked at the office clock. If he
would catch the one-forty train for
Lewes there was no leeway for hesitation.
He started toward the elevator,
then halted to read the clipping, which
might throw some light upon this staggering
manifesto:</p>


<p class="p2 center">THE LAST PILOT SCHOONER</p>

<p class="i2">The new steam pilot-boat will go into
commission off the Delaware Capes early
next week. This change from sail to
steam is another blow at the romance of
blue water. Six of the eight trim schooners
of the Delaware fleet have already
been dismantled, not only the <i>Albatross,
Number One</i> is cruising on the station.
She will be laid up as soon as the steamer
is ready to put the pilots aboard incoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
vessels. Every ocean voyager will regret
the passing of the pilot schooner. These
stormy petrels among sailing craft have
been the first messengers from the looked-for
land, as specks in the tumbling
waste of sea, or lying hove to in all
weathers....</p>


<p class="p2">Wilson threw his doubts overboard.
All he had ever read of bellying canvas,
whipping spars, and lee rails awash
leaped into the foreground of his boyish
imagination. Here was his chance for
such a "descriptive story" as he had
dreamed of through weeks and months,
this last cruise of the last pilot schooner.
He dashed into the art room, snatched up
the waiting camera, and bolted for the
station. After he dropped panting into
a seat of the accommodation train for
Lewes, he found himself already overhauling
his stock of sea-lore and sailor
adjectives.</p>

<p>There was time for reflection in this
four-hour journey to the sea, and ere
long, sober second thought began to overtake
his first wild elation. The young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
reporter's doubts came trooping back.
He remembered now that he had never
written a line of "ship-news" for the
<i>Standard</i>. He blushed to confess to himself
that his life on salt water had been
bounded by the decks of river excursion
steamers. And what had he ever done
worth the notice of the managing editor?
Of course, he had worked hard, and the
world, at least in fiction, occasionally rewarded
honest merit in lowly places with
unexpected largess. But any "star man"
of the staff would have given a week's
salary for such a note as this from the
chief executive of the <i>Standard</i>. And he,
James Arbuthnot Wilson, was indubitably
the rawest and humblest recruit of
that keen and rough-riding squadron of
talent.</p>

<p>An inevitable reaction swung his mood
into the forebodings. The train was loafing
along the upper reaches of Delaware
Bay when he re-read the intoxicating
note, and caught himself repeating "Dear
Mr. Wilson," with a sudden glimmer of
association. In another miserable moment
the youth's beautiful dream was wrenched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
from him. What a fool he had been!
"Wilson," "Wilson," he muttered and
burst out:</p>

<p>"Of course, there is another Wilson, the
tip-top man of the staff. It's the Wilson
who's been filling in as chief of the Washington
Bureau for six months. I heard
somebody say the other night that 'Doc'
Wilson was coming back, and was to go
on general work again. He must have
turned up over Sunday. And that new
boy put his note in my box. Well, I am
IT."</p>

<p>Young James Arbuthnot Wilson
squeezed back a smarting tear. He did
not try to fence with this surmise. There
was no room for doubt that the kind
words and the pleasant outing had been
aimed at his high-salaried elder. James
Arbuthnot had never clapped eyes on the
gifted "Doc" Wilson, whose Washington
dispatches had carried no signature and
whose distant personality had made no
impression upon this wretched understudy
of his.</p>

<p>How could the pilgrim muster courage
to go back and face the issue? He would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
be the office butt&mdash;Well, he could resign,
but most likely, he reflected, dismissal
would be the instant penalty of
this incredibly presumptuous blunder.
The only thing to be done was to drop
off at the next way station and return to
the scene of his downfall. But to his
stammering plea the brakeman returned:</p>

<p>"Next train up won't get along here
till late to-night. You better go through
to Lewes instead of waiting seven hours
at one of these next-to-nothing flag stations."</p>

<p>The reporter slumped into his seat and
looked through the open window. The
tang of brine was in the breeze that
gushed up the bay with the rising tide.
Across the green fields he began to
glimpse flashing blue water and bits of
the traffic of far-off seas. A deep-laden
tramp freighter was creeping toward her
port, a battered bark surged solemnly in
tow of an ocean-going tug, and a four-masted
schooner was reaching up the bay
with every sail pulling. Across the aisle
of the car Wilson noticed, with a melancholy
pleasure, four deep-tanned men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
rugged aspect, who played cards with
much talk of ships and tides and skippers.
They belonged in this picture.</p>

<p>Wilson thought of the stewing city far
behind him, and the spirit of some sea-faring
ancestor was whispering in his ear.
Yes, by Jove! he would see the tragic venture
through after all. It were better to
return with a "story," and fall with colors
flying than to slink back to empty ridicule.
Let them try to overtake him if
they dared. This was "Mr. Wilson's"
mission, and no one could snatch it from
him.</p>

<p>When the train labored into Lewes, the
fugitive looked across the flats to the cuddling
arm of the Breakwater and the shining
sea beyond. With the instinct of the
hunted, he made ready to flee in this direction,
away from the station and the town.
As he dropped from the car, a man in the
uniform of a station agent climbed aboard
and shouted:</p>

<p>"Telegram for Mr. Wilson. Is Mr.
Wilson aboard? Urgent telegram for
Mr. J. A. Wilson."</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson's pulse fluttered as he dove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
behind the warehouse across the tracks,
while the hoarse cry of the station agent
rang horribly in his ears. The long arm
of the <i>Standard</i> had almost clutched him
by the collar. As he hurried down the
nearest street to the water, he saw heading
toward him a lusty youth of a sailorish
cut, who eyed the camera case as if hasty
suspicions were confirmed.</p>

<p>"Is your name Wilson?" demanded the
stranger. "If it be, come along with me.
I'm from the <i>Albatross'</i> boat-crew."</p>

<p>Wondering how much guilt was written
in his face, Wilson fervently shook
the hand of the briny youth. They fared
toward the pier, while the convoy explained:</p>

<p>"You're in luck. We're ready to go
to sea as soon as you get aboard. Hit it
just right, didn't you? The pilots'll be
glad to see you again. They was tickled
to death over the piece you wrote for the
paper when the <i>Eben Tunnell, Number
Three</i>, come in after fightin' through the
'88 blizzard, and specially what you wrote
about ol' 'Pop' Markle stickin' by the
<i>Morgan Castle</i> when she ketched fire off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the Capes two year ago. And, say, they
still talk about that jack-pot you sky-hooted
clean through the cabin skylight,
and how th' Pilots' Association went in
mournin' for thirty days after that poker
game. Two o' them boys is aboard this
cruise, with the chips all stacked an'
waitin', and their knives whetted. I'm
sorry I missed the fun before."</p>

<p>James Arbuthnot Wilson gulped hard
at these lamentable tidings. He was
vaulting from the frying-pan into the
fire. These rude and reckless men would
probably heave him overboard. And,
alas, the penny-ante of his mild college
dissipations had left him as deficient in
poker prowess as in sea-lore. The foremast
hand from the <i>Albatross</i> was somewhat
crestfallen over his capture. If
this slip of a boy was the seasoned and
capable "Doc" Wilson, able to hold his
own in all weather and any company, then
appearances were basely deceiving, and
the escort felt a sense of personal grievance.</p>

<p>The boat was waiting at the pier and
the four slouching seamen rowed out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the black schooner, which lazily rolled her
gleaming sides off the end of the Breakwater.
Wilson climbed awkwardly aboard
and was saved from sprawling his length
on deck by a strong hand, which yanked
him in a welcoming grip. Then a stocky
man with a grizzled mustache stepped
back and fairly shouted:</p>

<p>"Why, hell! You ain't 'Doc' Wilson.
What kind of a game is this? I popped
up from below in time to see your hat
coming over the side. Kick me, please.
I'm dreamin', as sure as my name's McCall."</p>

<p>He fished a rumpled telegram from
his blue clothes, and flourished it before
the nose of his guest, as he cried formidably:</p>

<p>"Read that!"</p>


<p class="p2 i2">"'Doc' Wilson, of the <i>Standard</i>, will be
down on afternoon train. Take him
aboard and treat him right."</p>


<p class="p2">Young Wilson looked at the half mile
of water between the schooner and the
beach, and thought of trying to swim for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
it. But the bully-ragging tone of the
pilot struck a spark of his latent pluck
and he answered with some spirit:</p>

<p>"I'm mighty sorry you're so disappointed.
My name is Wilson, James Arbuthnot
Wilson, of the <i>Standard</i>. The
order to join your boat was delivered to
me. If there's been a mistake, and I'm
so unwelcome, I'll have to put you to the
trouble of setting me ashore again."</p>

<p>The innate hospitality of his kind
smothered the pilot's first emotions, and
he regretted his rudeness as he smote the
lad on the back and shouted:</p>

<p>"All right, Jimmy Arbutus. I guess
there's no great damage done. It's now
or never for your newspaper, and if we
can't carry the skipper, we'll get along
with the mate of your outfit. And we'll
give you a cruise to make your lead-pencil
smoke. Tumble below and shake them
natty clothes. The boat-keeper will fit
you out with a pair of boots and a
jumper."</p>

<p>Sore and abashed, with the hateful
emotions of an intruder, Wilson crept
below and faced another ordeal. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
pilots' roomy cabin, which ran half the
length of the schooner, four men were
changing their clothes and tidying up
their bunks. One of them emerged from
the confusion to yell at the invader's
patent leather ties:</p>

<p>"Hello, Doc, you old pirate. Is that
you? Glad to see you aboard. Well, I
will be damned!"</p>

<p>His jaw dropped and he looked sheepish
as a hurricane voice came through the
open skylight:</p>

<p>"Don't hurt the kid's feelin's. I've
done plenty of that. This is Jimmy Arbutus
Wilson, apprentice to 'Doc,' and
he's doin' the best he can. 'Doc' got
stranded somewheres, and the lad is
takin' his run. I don't fathom it a little
bit, but what's the odds?"</p>

<p>The passenger was introduced to all
hands, who showed a depressing lack of
enthusiasm, and the pilots returned to
their tasks. Wilson retired, blushing and
confused, to the edge of his bunk. Presently
the oldest man of the party sat down
beside the intruder, and shook his hand
for the second time. Wilson raised his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
downcast face to the white-haired veteran,
who said softly:</p>

<p>"Now, sonny, don't let the boys rile you
none. They're kinder sore on some of the
greenhorns that writes pieces all wrong
for the Philadelphy papers, and this 'Doc'
Wilson knows sailor ways and sailor
lingo, and they sorter took a shine to him
and his style. But fur's I know, you can
write rings around him. And Old Pop
Markle, as they calls me, will see you
through, blow high, blow low. It's my
last cruise, this is. I'm past seventy year,
sonny, and my oldest boy is a pilot; he
brought a tanker in yestiddy, and my
grandson is servin' his apprentice years,
and he'll be gettin' his papers pretty soon.
It's time for me to quit. I was goin' to
lay up ashore in the spring, but I kinder
wanted to wind up with the old <i>Albatross</i>.
Better come on deck, sonny; we're shortenin'
cable."</p>

<p>Wilson smiled his gratitude at the gentle
and garrulous old pilot, whose smooth-shaven
face was webbed with fine-drawn
wrinkles, as if each salty cruise had left
its own recording line. The blue eyes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
faded from staring into fifty years of sun
and wind, but they held a beaming interest
in the welfare of this tyro struggling
in the meshes of hostile circumstance.</p>

<p>The reporter followed his guardian on
deck, and his spirits swiftly rose. The
<i>Albatross</i> was paying off under a flattened
forestaysail, while her crew tailed
onto the main-sheet with a roaring chorus,
for they, too, felt a thrill of sentiment in
this last cruise. The wind held fresh from
the south'ard, and under the smooth lee
of Cape Henlopen the <i>Albatross</i> shot
seaward, as if they were skating over a
polished floor. Now the pilots came tumbling
up, and shouted as they turned to
and helped set the maintopsail and staysail.
The schooner staggered down to it,
until the white water hissed over her low
bulwark, and sobbed through the scuppers.
"Old Pop" Markle slapped his
knee and cried huskily:</p>

<p>"Give her all she'll stand, boys. It's
like old times when we raced that dodgasted
<i>Number Four</i> and hung to the
weather riggin' by our teeth, and bent a
new suit of sails every other cruise."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Holding the wind abeam, the <i>Albatross</i>
drove straight out to sea, and then, once
clear of Cape May, slid off to the north'ard.
Now, the quartering sea picked her
up and she swooped down the slopes and
tried nimbly to climb the frothing hills,
as the jolly wind smote her press of canvas
and jammed her smoking through
them. A new exhilaration surged in
young Wilson's veins. He was drinking
it all in, the buoyant flight of the low, slim
schooner, the intimate nearness of the sea,
the sweetness of the wind, and the solemnity
of the marching twilight. He would
not have been elsewhere for worlds. Then
the fat and sweating face of the cook appeared
from below, and bellowed an inarticulate
summons.</p>

<p>The pilots obeyed with ardor, and Wilson
followed timidly in their wake. Supper
smoked on the cabin table, and the
guest was glad to survey the stout fare of
hash, cold meat, potatoes, green peas,
flaky hot biscuits, and a mammoth pudding.
"Old Pop" Markle took the youngster
under his protecting wing, and found
a seat on the locker beside his own. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
reporter fell to, while the pilots chatted
with bursts of gusty laughter. He made
one desperate rally to join the talk, and
in a quiet moment asked a neighbor:</p>

<p>"How do you know when a ship wants
a pilot?"</p>

<p>"We generally have a trained green
parrot that flies over and asks 'em," was
the cruel response. "But we ran short of
stores last cruise, and had to eat him. This
voyage we intend to mail 'em postal
cards."</p>

<p>There was an appreciative roar, and
Wilson winced as "Old Pop" Markle
whispered:</p>

<p>"Don't mind that Peter Haines. He's
got a heart as soft as mush. It's only
their skylarkin', sonny. Hit 'em back.
That's what they like."</p>

<p>But the victim had lost all self-confidence,
and now he was beginning to feel
dizzy and forlorn. The smell of food, the
heat, and the jerky plunging of the cabin
were overwhelming. He staggered to
his bunk and crept in. This was the last
blow, that on top of his false pretences
he should be laid low before the eyes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
this hostile crowd. He knew not what
happened, until hours after he awoke
from a semi-stupor to find "Old Pop"
Markle sponging his face with cold water
and calling in his ear:</p>

<p>"There's a steamer coming up from the
east'ard. Brace up and get on deck. It's
a pretty sight."</p>

<p>The boy clambered through the companionway
as the boat-keeper touched a
match to an oil-soaked bunch of waste in
a wire cage at the end of his torch. The
schooner and the near-by sea were bathed
in a yellow glare. Out in the darkness a
blue Coston light glowed a response.
Some one shouted: "On deck for the
skiff," and five minutes later the boat-crew
was pulling off in the night to the
waiting steamer, with a pilot in the stern-sheets.</p>

<p>"There goes your friend, Peter
Haines," chuckled "Pop" Markle. "I
knowed you'd take it hard if I didn't give
you a chance to say good-bye to him. He
won't pester you no more this cruise."</p>

<p>The wind blew some of the cobwebs
from poor Wilson's muddled head, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
felt refreshed. Soon the pelting spray
drove him below deck and he curled up on
a locker, watching the poker game from
which youth and inexperience barred him.
And what was more cutting, he was not
even asked to play.</p>

<p>"It would be like taking pennies from
a blind child," callously commented the
strapping McCall who had welcomed him
aboard. But the white-haired patriarch
of them all did not join the game, and he
said cheerily to Wilson:</p>

<p>"You're too young and I'm too old to
be wastin' our wages in them pursuits,
ain't we, sonny? There's an old lady and
a cottage at Lewes that takes care of my
rake-off. And instid of raisin' the limit,
I raise vegetubbles for my fun."</p>

<p>Wilson opened his bruised heart and
told the old pilot the story of his venture,
and felt relieved that his masquerade had
been thrown away. "Pop" Markle's blue
eyes twinkled:</p>

<p>"See here, Jimmy Arbutus, I'll see that
you write a fust-rate piece for your paper.
Ask me anything your amazin' ignorance
tells you to. The boys wanted me to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
in the fust vessel we met, and was willin'
to shove their turns aside, but I told 'em it
was my last cruise, and I was goin' to see
her through to the finish. So we've lots of
time to talk pilotin' together. What was
the most remarkable experience ever I
had? Pshaw, that sounds like a full-rigged
reporter, sonny, really it does.</p>

<p>"Well, I never got drownded boardin'
a vessel, but I once fell afoul of a skipper
that was a worse blunderin' idjit than
you've been. It may sound kinder comfortin'
to you. About fifty miles off the
Capes, I clumb aboard an Italian bark.
Her captain said he was bound for Wilmington,
and would I take him in? He
got a tow-boat at the Breakwater, and we
were goin' up the river all right, when
plumb by accident this benighted Dago
imparted to me that he was bound for
Wilmington, North Caroliny. 'Great
Scott! You dodgasted lunatic,' says I,
'you're pretty nigh up to Wilmington,
Delaware.' He went crazier than ever,
and put about for sea after I showed him
on the chart where he was at. He had
been runnin' by dead-reckonin', and didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
know where he was. So, when he picked
up a pilot and found he was headed all
right for Wilmington, he figured his
troubles were over. So there's worse than
you afloat, Jimmy Arbutus."</p>

<p>At his suggestion, Wilson dug up his
notebook and scribbled therein many other
yarns, for the old pilot warmed to his task,
and insisted that each of the poker players
should contribute a story to the fund.
When he was routed out for breakfast,
the party had lost another pilot who had
found his ship at daybreak. The wind
had drawn into the northeast, and the
<i>Albatross</i> was snuggled down under double
reefs. The barometer was falling,
and the boat-keeper shook his head when
the pilots insisted upon edging further off
shore.</p>

<p>"Drive her till she cracks," shouted McCall.
"This is the trip when we keep
going till we get our ships. The <i>Albatross</i>
goes home empty, you bet your
boots."</p>

<p>With much daring and difficulty one
man was put aboard a liner late in the
afternoon. Three pilots were left, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
they swept Wilson into their genial comradeship,
as the little party clawed its way
to supper, and hung onto the table by its
eyelids. In his mind, Wilson began to see
the page story, "full of human interest
and color." To-morrow he would work
at his "introduction," and the thought of
really making a start at filling those
stately columns was perturbing. He felt
something like stage-fright at the notion
of it.</p>

<p>Before midnight, James Arbuthnot
Wilson had forgotten his "story," and
was thinking only of the awful turmoil
above him. The wind had leaped to the
might of a sudden summer gale. The
schooner was hove to and battened tight,
and like a tightly corked bottle she danced
over the shouting seas. Made sick and
giddy, Wilson sought "Old Pop" Markle,
who was peacefully snoring in the next
bunk, and shook him awake.</p>

<p>"Pshaw, sonny," the old man muttered,
"she's safer than a big ship. She'll rare
and tear and sputter till it blows over.
If it'll ease your mind any, I'll take a peek
on deck."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>The pilot slipped into his oil-skins and
vanished.</p>

<p>"It's pretty thick," he said when he
came below, "but there ain't no great sea
on, not for us. Rainin' hard and blowin'
some. McCall is standin' watch with the
boat-keeper. You're safer than if you
was in the <i>Standard</i> office. You can't lose
your job out here, Jimmy."</p>

<p>Somewhat comforted, Wilson tried to
sleep. It was a terrifying experience for
the greenhorn, with more "local color"
than he had bargained for. Some time
later in the night he was half dreaming
that "Doc" Wilson was holding his head
under water and drowning him with the
most enjoyable deliberation.</p>

<p>With a crashing sound like the explosion
of a great gun in his ears, he was
flung headlong clear across the cabin, and
on top of him came "Old Pop" Markle,
sputtering harmless curses. The cabin
floor sloped like the side of a house and
stayed there as Wilson scrambled to his
hands and knees. Then came a more
sickening lurch, and before the hanging
cabin lamp was smashed against the deck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>-beams,
the lad saw that the old man was
dazed. He gave him a hand, and together
they climbed the slope, and grasped the
legs of the stationary table. They heard
the other pilots stumble up the companion
ladder, and hammer back the hatch, with
yells of terror lest they be trapped.</p>

<p>Forward of the cabin bulkhead, they
heard the roar of inrushing water, and
smothered outcries among the watch below.
While the old man and the boy tried
to grope their way aft to the ladder, the
sea crashed through the bulkhead door
from the galley beyond, and instantly
they were picked up and hurled aft, choking
and fighting for life. Wilson chanced
to grasp a step of the ladder, and with his
free arm pulled "Old Pop" Markle to
this refuge. The reporter did not want
to die, and he knew that death dragged
him by the heels. And it was with no
heroic prompting that he pushed the old
man up ahead of him. It was done on
the instant, as one friend would help another
in a pinch, without wrought-out
purpose.</p>

<p>The water was sucking at his waist as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
he fought his way up, and partly out, and
managed to double himself over the hatch
coaming, with the old man's legs across his
shoulders. Thus they were half jammed
in the cramped exit. Just then the flare
torch was lighted by a seaman. In the
yellow glare "Old Pop" Markle saw the
two pilots and two, only two, of the crew
wrestling with the one skiff left at the
davits. One of them stopped to beckon
wildly to the old man and started to go to
his aid.</p>

<p>In this moment the schooner lurched
under with a weary, lifeless roll, and a
black sea stamped across her sodden hull.
It licked up the boat and the handful of
toiling men, it leaped forward and pulled
down the black figure with the torch. The
two men still jammed in the hatchway
were cruelly battered, but they could not
be wrenched away. And when the towering
comber had passed, there was darkness
and silence, and no more shouting voices
on the schooner's deck.</p>

<p>The old pilot wriggled free and got his
hands on a life-buoy that hung within his
reach at the after end of the cabin hatch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Wilson dragged himself after him, and
pitched against a splintered mass of
planking upended against the wheel.
They listened and heard a steamer's imploring
whistle, and one faint cry off to
leeward. "Pop" Markle groaned as he
fumbled in the darkness and laboriously
passed a tangle of line around the wreck
of the skylight cover to which Wilson
was clinging.</p>

<p>"Hang on, sonny," he gasped. "I've
made the buoy fast to the loose timber.
We'll go off together with the next sea,
sure. My God! here it comes."</p>

<p>The dying schooner seemed to sink
from beneath them, and clinging to their
frail bit of a raft, they were spun off to
leeward in the arms of the sea that
swamped the rock-ballasted <i>Albatross</i>.
Turned over and over, the two men
fought for breath until the skylight cover
righted, and they came to the surface.
They slid swiftly into a murky hollow,
and were borne to the tattered crest whose
froth was strangling.</p>

<p>But the wind was falling fast. Such
seas as those which had broken over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the helpless <i>Albatross</i> were running in
swollen billows when they met no barrier
to check them. Therefore the castaways
could cling and breathe, and even made
shift to pass the loose ends of the line
around their waists while they waited for
the end. Now their spray-blinded eyes
dimly saw the lights of the steamer that
had bitten halfway through the pilot-schooner.
She was blundering far to
windward, and her signal rockets cut red
gashes in the night. They could watch
her swing in a useless circle as she sought
to find the craft she had struck. Drifting
away to leeward, the old pilot and the
young reporter tried to shout, but their
little rasping cries were pitifully futile.
They coughed the racking brine from
their throats, and saw the last rocket soar,
saw the steamer's lights fade in the rain,
become twinkling points and vanish.</p>

height="582" alt="" title="" />
<div class="caption">
<i>The last of the "Albatross."</i></div></div>


<p class="p2">There were no words between them until
the day began to break. Now and then
one sought the other's hand and found a
feebly responsive grip. Thus they knew
that death had not come to the little raft.
With the gray light, the wind veered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
round to the south'ard, and except for the
swinging swell, the sea was smoothed to
summer gentleness. The eternal miracle
of dawn had never come to more grateful
hearts than these two. Youth had survived
the battering ordeal with mind still
alert, but old age was near passing with
hurts and exhaustion. Now that he could
see no help, the boy so managed it that the
pilot could lie half across the life-buoy,
which floated high with the supporting
planking beneath it.</p>

<p>"Them as wasn't drownded and
smashed in their bunks, couldn't swim, or
none to speak of," sighed the old man.
"I knew 'em all from boys. Two left....
And we're the most wuthless of
the lot, sonny. But you may learn how
to make an honest livin' some day....
Don't bother with me.... I'm due
to go.... The old lady has the cottage,
and there's the pension from the
Pilot's Fund.... And two more
pilots in the family.... Ain't you
sorry you didn't let 'Doc' Wilson come?"</p>

<p>The boy sputtered:</p>

<p>"No, we aren't dead yet, and if we're<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
picked up it's the story of a lifetime. I
don't believe the Lord saved us from the
wreck to die on a summer morning like
this. And, my, but you were good to me,
Mr. Markle."</p>

<p>They floated in silence while the June
sun rose higher, and heat and thirst piled
up their wretchedness. The seasoned fiber
of the old man had been toughened for
such a stress as this. He hung on grimly
because he had always hung on grimly to
whatever life set him to endure. Although
they were out on the edge of traffic bound
in and out of the Delaware Capes, he still
hoped, but mostly for the boy.</p>

<p>Six hours after the <i>Albatross</i> had gone
to the bottom, a boat from a crippled brig,
laden with salt from Turk's Island,
picked up a bit of wreckage to which were
lashed a white-haired man and a beardless
lad. Both were too weak to talk, and the
British skipper had them put into bunks,
and poured raw Jamaica rum down their
throats. Wilson was the first to revive,
but he could not rise, and had to content
himself with tidings that the pilot was
alive and conscious. Night had come be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>fore
the reporter could totter as far as the
mate's cabin and see his comrade.</p>

<p>The pilot's leathery face was strangely
bleached, and he could no more than whisper
with a faltering huskiness:</p>

<p>"God bless their poor souls. They was
all neighbors of mine. Hello, Jimmy Arbutus,
have you begun to write that piece
for the paper? There's something wrong
with my insides. I think I busted some of
'em when we was jammed in that hatch.
Well, we're going home, my son. Are
you all taut again?"</p>

<p>Wilson tried to hide his anxiety and set
himself to nursing the old man as best he
could. His clumsy attentions were received
with a sweet resignation, but the
old man showed signs of impatience. At
length, unable to restrain his desire, he
asked:</p>

<p>"Why don't you begin to write your
piece instead of wastin' time on my old
hulk? I want to see it's done all ship-shape.
We ain't goin' to have no 'Doc'
Wilson nor a lot of fresh young pilots
laughin' at our blunders. I'll overhaul the
writin' for you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Wilson was eager to begin. The skipper
found a half-filled log-book, and the
butt of a pencil, and the reporter sat by
the pilot's bunk, and wrote with frowning
effort. His labor was so evident that at
length the interested pilot asked:</p>

<p>"You seem to be making heavy weather
of it, Jimmy. Mind my lookin' over the
nigh end of it?"</p>

<p>Wilson passed the log-book over with a
flutter of expectancy. He was proud of
his opening paragraphs. He flattered
himself that he had caught the spirit of
the tragedy of the last and lost pilot-schooner.
The old man read them with
puckered brow, and laid the book down
without comment. Wilson waited and
had to break the awkward silence:</p>

<p>"Anything the matter with that?"</p>

<p>"Well, I had only a common school education,
and I've been at sea fifty years.
I'm no judge, I guess. It's too high-falutin'
for me. Those dictionary words
are mighty imposin', and the opening
verse of poetry looks gilt-edged. But,
well, every man to his trade."</p>

<p>The very young reporter looked hurt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and the pilot tried to soothe him by flatly
denying the truth of everything he had
said. Wilson put the book away and
went on deck. In his mind there was
a glimmering notion that his literary
method might be open to criticism. The
old fear and lack of self-confidence came
back. He would rest another day and try
again.</p>

<p>Next morning the brig was beating
against a baffling wind, and the Delaware
Capes were two hundred and fifty miles
away. A mattress was brought on deck,
and the old man was laid on it beneath an
awning. He was growing weaker, and
began to fret when he found the brig was
making so little headway toward her port
and his home. Wilson was moody and
worried about his comrade. He had no
heart for his "story."</p>

<p>After a while the British skipper sat
down beside the old man, and began to
ask him about the loss of the <i>Albatross</i>.
The pilot began with the start of the last
cruise, and with crisp and homely detail,
and with many breaks in his voice, he carried
the tale down to the loss of the ves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>sel,
the loss of his comrades, and the escape
of the oldest and youngest of those that
had sailed in her. And because he felt it
all so deeply, the story did not once wander
from its chartered course.</p>

<p>Wilson pulled himself together and
picked up his log-book. He felt that it
was his duty to write what he heard.
When he had finished, the scales fell from
his eyes, for at a great price he had been
taught to discern that virtue of simplicity
which most of his craft must spend years
to learn. When the pilot fell into a doze,
he stole below and began to write his
"story." It was not all as the pilot had
told it, but its backbone and its vitals
belonged to the simple and untutored
old man. Next day when he read it to
"Pop" Markle the pilot brightened and
observed:</p>

<p>"Any sailor could understand that, my
lad. It sounds as dodgasted ordinary as
if I had wrote it myself. The pilots will
think a heap of that piece. I want you to
hold your job, sonny."</p>

<p>The third day passed, and then the
fourth, and the booming head wind was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
holding the lubberly brig out of sight of
the Delaware Capes. The pilot insisted
that he be carried on deck whenever the
sun shone. He was looking for the Henlopen
light. When he was not drowsy, he
would talk of home to his young comrade,
for all his thoughts were flocking thither.</p>

<p>"I don't think I'm going to fetch it,
sonny," he murmured when the fifth day
broke with no land in sight. "It looks
like you're going to be the sole survivor
of the <i>Albatross</i>. That will make your
piece a heap stronger, won't it? My own
boy couldn't have done more for me than
you have. If we don't pick up the Capes
by noon, I want you to write a letter for
me to Mary, that's my wife. You can
take it ashore at Lewes. You'll find the
cottage easy enough. And you must go
around and look at my vegetubbles. One
of my boys will be home, and he'll see that
they get my hulk to the buryin' ground.
The skipper here has promised to anchor
long enough to send me ashore."</p>

<p>Wilson choked, and tried to cheer the
old man. But the faded blue eyes were
serene with the foreknowledge of his end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
The letter was written at his dictation, and
Wilson sobbed while he went below to
find an envelope in the skipper's desk.
Then the pilot tried to sign it, and his
knotted brown fingers held the pencil
while Wilson helped him trace the wavering:</p>

<p>"Your loving Seth."</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon of this, the fifth
day, a tiny shaft, like a beckoning finger,
cut the cloudless western skyline. Seth
Markle heard the shouts of the men clustered
forward who were eager to bring
him the longed-for news. Wilson and the
skipper came to him, and propped him up
in his pillows on the poop-deck.</p>

<p>"Henlopen light," he whispered. "Henlopen
light, and Lewes just around the
Point."</p>

<p>The dim light of life burned brighter
in this draught of hope, but soon waned
lower than before. After a long silence,
the old man tried to speak. Wilson put
his ear close to the resolute mouth, and
could barely hear:</p>

<p>"Tell her how good you've been to me.
I&mdash;I hope the piece is all right. The last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
cruise.... Oh, Mary, you're waiting
around the Point of the Cape."</p>

<p>He was alive until sunset, but he did not
speak, except once when Wilson thought
he heard a fluttering whisper of "Mary,"
and after that the rough-hewn face became
very peaceful.</p>

<p>The brig crept into the lee of the Breakwater
soon after daylight next morning.
Wilson went ashore and found the cottage
with the marvelous vegetable garden,
and a sweet-faced woman who read
her letter while the bearer walked softly
among the cabbage rows, and noted, with
a quick pang, how lovingly they had been
tended. Presently Mary Markle came
to him, and put her motherly arms around
his neck and kissed him through her
tears. They went to a near-by cottage
where dwelt the eldest son. There Wilson
left them. Before he went away he
said:</p>

<p>"He was the best friend I ever had.
I'm coming down day after to-morrow.
May I go to the church with you?"</p>

<p>He had to tarry in the streets, for the
news had spread, and other weeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
wives of pilots and seamen pressed around
him. When, as tenderly as possible, he
was able to leave them, he went to the telegraph
office and sent this message to the
managing editor of the <i>Standard</i>:</p>

<p>"Just landed. Am sole survivor of pilot
schooner <i>Albatross</i> run down and foundered
a week ago. Will report with my
story at noon."</p>

<p>On the train Wilson added to his
"story" in the old log-book the facts of
the last days of Pilot Seth Markle. His
pencil quivered and balked when he recalled
the words and face of his gentle
old critic, and somehow, through his tears,
he brought the narrative of the last cruise
to its unadorned conclusion. Then he
closed the book and leaned back with a
great weariness. Now he was passing
that bright vista of shore through which
he had first seen the Bay, where he had
chosen to advance rather than to retreat.
Those intervening days seemed like years
of life. He had gone away a boy, he was
coming back a man.</p>

<p>When the young reporter walked into
the <i>Standard</i> office, the first man to greet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
him was a bald and bulky stranger with
an impressive manner, who said:</p>

<p>"Ah, the young hero, I presume. You
had a great streak of luck, didn't you?
Glad to see you pulled through. My
name is Wilson. I'm to take your notes
at once and work up the story from them.
We're going to play as the leading feature
in to-morrow's paper, and follow up
with a page for Sunday."</p>

<p>Young Wilson looked at "Doc" Wilson
with a new assertiveness and threw
back his slight shoulders as he replied:</p>

<p>"No, thank you. Nothing doing. My
story is written, and it's going to be
turned in to the boss as it stands. I'm
going in to see him now."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense," snapped "Doc" Wilson.
"I can understand your wanting to
do the story, and your head being swelled
a bit and all that. But if you want to
hold your job you'd better fork over
your notes without any more fuss about
it. The old man passed it out that he
was going to fire you, anyhow. I'll say a
good word for you if you can produce
the goods."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Young Wilson brushed past his elder,
who stood dumbfounded at the insolence
of the "pup." Then the managing editor
was confronted by an unabashed intruder,
who announced:</p>

<p>"Here's my story, sir. There's about
six columns of it. And it's all ready to be
edited. And no 'Doc' Wilson nor anybody
else is going to rewrite it until you've
passed on it."</p>

<p>The managing editor saw a bedraggled
figure with a firm-set jaw and a level
glance which looked him squarely in the
eyes. He took in the sea-stained clothes,
and the burned and grimy face, and
smiled as he said:</p>

<p>"I'll read it, Mr. Wilson. Go home and
come back at six o'clock. Then we'll talk
it over. You've been through a tremendous
experience, haven't you? It's your
story. Don't fret about that."</p>

<p>When James Arbuthnot Wilson next
entered the managing editor's office, that
dignified personage grasped his hand and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"My son, why haven't I known you
could write a story like this? It's the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
thing. It's a masterpiece. Where did
you learn how?"</p>

<p>The boy's face twitched as he said very
slowly:</p>

<p>"The man who taught me how died in
sight of home. It's his story. It isn't mine
at all. I want a day off, if you please,
to go down to Lewes again. I'm&mdash;I'm
the last of the <i>Albatross</i>."</p>

<p>Private Saunders, of the
Ninth Infantry, was flushed and
dazed with fever, but able to walk
from the ambulance up a stone stairway
into what looked to him like a huge and
gilded warehouse. At first glance, he did
not see the long rows of cots whose gray
blankets blended with the carpet of dusk
and shadow in the late winter afternoon.
Monstrous golden dragons seemed to
writhe and flicker against the roof beams
far above him, or twist in play on lines of
massive columns. Saunders dropped his
kit and leaned on his rifle while he rubbed
his eyes with a trembling hand. If this
was the hospital of the American army in
Peking, he wished that some one would
turn out the guard and capture the menagerie
that had taken possession. Sliding
uncertain feet across the flagged
floor, he fell over a cot and gripped a protesting
leg, whose owner sputtered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
"Get off o' me, you left-footed lobster.
Ain't there no chance for a man to be sick
without the roof fallin' on him? Why,
hello, Jim, what in blazes is the matter
with you? Brace up and holler for the
orderly. He's somewhere down at the
end of the line, packin' up what's left of
Chase of P Company, who just passed
in his checks."</p>

<p>Saunders sat on the edge of the cot
and wept with the whimper of a tired
child:</p>

<p>"Is it the hospital sure enough, Shorty?
All them ten-foot dragons makin' faces
at me in the dark ain't comfortin' to a
man with wheels in his head. Guess this
must be the Emp'ror's private temple.
Why, here's a dozen o' my pals spraddled
around over the floor. I've hit the right
place, all right. Lead me to my bunk, an'
get me bedded down."</p>

<p>The overworked hospital corps private,
who was nurse and orderly for the ward,
picked up the accouterments of Saunders,
and helped him crawl under the blankets
of the cot alongside "Shorty" Blake. The
contract surgeon, delaying to question a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
group of convalescents in the courtyard,
came in to examine the new patient, and
said "pneumonia" to the nurse. Saunders
heard nothing of the consultation,
for he was looking up into the gloom of
the distant rafters, and trying to count
the racing gilded dragons that would not
be still and made his head ache intolerably.
When lanterns were lighted at the ends of
each aisle, the shadows danced worse than
before, and to his fevered eyes the great
temple was populous with glittering
shapes in terrifying agitation.</p>

<p>This, the largest of the clustered buildings
in the park of the Temple of Earth,
was an extraordinary hospital, even in
daylight. Sacred to the annual pilgrimage
of the Emperor in his worship of the
Supreme Deity, these temples had been
inviolate for many centuries until profaned
by the conquering foreign allies.
The walled park became the camp of
the American forces, and one of the most
sacred shrines of the land was used as
a field hospital. A regiment could have
been drilled on the marble pavement without
crowding, and the two hundred sick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
soldiers scattered in the vastness of it were
bitten with a sense of chilling desolation.</p>

<p>Between flights of delirium, through
his first night in hospital, Saunders heard
the groans and restless muttering of many
men, and his fancies magnified them into
an army. There were neither screens nor
walls to divide the wards, only the rows
of cots between the carved pillars that
marched across the temple floor, so that
all individual suffering and the tenacious
struggle of dying became common property.
The soldiers who passed away in
the night time did not trouble their comrades
so much as when death came in daylight,
and the end was a spectacle thrust
upon those in surrounding cots.</p>

<p>A little after midnight the tramp of
stretcher bearers punctuated a thin and
wailing outcry, coming from that which
they bore, and the temple floor awoke with
weary curses. Those near the doorway
learned that a Chinese coolie, caught in
the act of stealing coal from the quartermaster's
corral, had been tumbled off a
wall by a sentry's shot. The lamentations
of the victim rasped sick nerves beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
endurance, and the hospital held no sympathy
in its smallest crevice. The coolie
was an old man and badly hurt. Opium
had made him impervious to customary
doses of morphine, and after he had been
drugged in quantities to kill four men,
he was no nearer rest. From a far corner
of the temple the wounded coolie wailed
an unending</p>

<p>"Ay oh"&mdash;"Ay oh"&mdash;"Ay oh!"</p>

<p>Soldiers rose in their blankets and made
uproar with cries of&mdash;</p>

<p>"Kill him!"</p>

<p>"Smother the brute!"</p>

<p>"Give him an overdose!"</p>

<p>"Now, ain't this an outrage!"</p>

<p>"Hi, there, One Lung, give us a rest,
for God's sake!"</p>

<p>"Throw him out in the yard."</p>

<p>Daylight brought to Saunders infinitely
grateful respite from a world
through which he had fled from flaming
dragons that shrieked, as if in torture:</p>

<p>"Ay oh"&mdash;"Ay oh"&mdash;"Ay oh!"</p>

<p>The grip of his delirium weakened in
a few days, and the surgeon called him a
"mild case." At the end of a week,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Saunders was able to sit up a little and
talk with the men around him. But the
violence of these early impressions in hospital
had unstrung a system drained by
long service in the Philippines, and by the
contrasting hardships of the cold winter
in North China. The gloomy temple
frightened the soldier, for sometimes the
private has nerves, but he kept his fears to
himself, thinking them womanish. He
fell to brooding too much of home, and
the more he dwelt upon the distance between
Peking and those who loved him the
more insistent became his morbid fear that
he would not go back with his company.</p>

<p>It happened almost daily that the Ninth
Regiment band trailed through the hospital
compound, playing a dead march.
There was always a halt in front of the
stone stairway, and after a few moments
the dragging music sounded fainter and
farther away. A little later those in the
temple could barely hear the silvery wail
of "taps" floating from a corner of the
outer wall, where a line of mounds was
growing longer week by week. Then the
band returned, playing a Sousa march or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
a "rag-time" medley. The listeners in
hospital filled in the gaps between the
music, and the mind of Saunders was
busiest of them all in picturing the routine
of a soldier's funeral in Peking.</p>

<p>The surgeons looked him over in morning
inspection rounds, and said there was
nothing the matter to prevent his recovery.
"Shorty" Blake and "Bat" Jenkins
of P Company strove to make Saunders
take some interest in life, and would have
been cheered if he had even sworn at the
rations and the lack of hospital comforts.
They brought him jam and condensed
milk from the commissary-sergeant,
which he refused to eat; they
assembled around his cot the most vivacious
convalescents, selecting as entertainers
those valiant in poker and campaign
stories. Finally Saunders was
persuaded to overhaul his haversack and
show his slender store of souvenirs gathered
in Peking. Blake and Jenkins
moved over to pass opinion on the riches,
and Saunders welcomed them tremulously:</p>

<p>"I was plannin' to take some things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
home to mother and sister," he began,
"but I didn't have a chance to get much
while the lootin' was busy. Wouldn't
have done me any good if I had, when
the captain had the tents searched and
collared most of the company stuff. I
ain't sorry I missed it on the loot, for the
old lady 'ud throw out o' the window all
the stuff I sent her, if she thought it
wasn't paid for. She's fierce in backin'
foreign missions, an' the Chinamen is her
purticuler pets."</p>

<p>Shorty broke in with an oath: "Yes, I
know all about P Company's captain and
his hair-trigger conscience. He swiped
all our loot, but he sent home forty-seven
mail packages, duty free. I got that
from the postal clerk. What you got
left, Saunders?"</p>

<p>The invalid spread an embroidered
panel of crimson satin and a roll of blue
silk on the edge of his cot, and threw a
handful of silver ornaments and a cloisonné
snuff-box on the blankets.</p>

<p>"I didn't loot even this stuff," he said,
with an apologetic air, "but bought it
along the Chien-men Road, so it could go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
to the home folks with a clean bill of
ladin'."</p>

<p>The spectators sniffed incredulously,
but with unexpected tact hid any livelier
display of doubt.</p>

<p>"Why don't you mail the goods home
with a letter, and send a good jolly?" said
Jenkins. "We'll get 'em off for you.
There's a mail wagon goin' to Tientsin
early to-morrow mornin'. Tell the old
lady you're fat an' sassy. She'll call in
the whole village to show 'em the presents
from her brave soldier boy out among
them poor, benighted, gentle, murderous
Chinese heathen."</p>

<p>Saunders rallied for the afternoon,
scrawled a letter, and sent his gifts. Then
he buried his head in the blankets and
wept, the effort having stirred new depths
of hopeless homesickness. Through the
following week he failed to gain in
strength and spirits, and the surgeon mentioned
"nostalgia" once or twice in chatting
with the nurse.</p>

<p>"He may lie there and flutter out, with
no disease worth a diagnosis," said the
"medico." "The poor idiot thinks he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
would die on the way if he was shipped
across country to Taku, to connect with a
transport; and he's sure he'll be buried
if he stays here. If we can get a little
strength in him, I'll see what I can do to
get him started home."</p>

<p>Saunders was not yet a dying man, but
the natural process of recovery seemed at
a standstill. There came a sharp turn for
the worse after "Shorty" Blake limped in
with a letter, which he tossed to the languid
private with a cheery shout of&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wake up, Jim; here's the latest news
from home. Hurry and tell us the price
of butter an' eggs at the corner store."</p>

<p>But Saunders read the letter in silence,
and while he read, his thin young face
twitched, tears came, and the helpless
length of him moved in little jerks that
rippled the blankets.</p>

<p>The chaffing queries of his comrades
were unanswered, and the patient seemed
to be asleep through the afternoon and
evening. When the light of the next
morning filtered through the latticed
windows of oiled paper, "Shorty" Blake
saw Saunders grope for the letter under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the blanket roll that served him for a
pillow, and read it again. His voice was
weaker than before, as he beckoned Blake
and Jenkins to the cot, and said:</p>

<p>"Here's what comes of my leavin' home
to be buried in this muck-heap of a town&mdash;an'
my folks turned out to starve. You
might as well read it, though you can't do
any good."</p>

<p>Shorty saw a woman's handwriting,
and he took the closely written sheets with
singular gentleness. The spelling was
imperfect in spots, and there were many
erasures, but he stumbled through the uncertain
lines, which said:</p>


<p class="p2 i2">"<span class="smcap">My dearest Son</span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="i2">"No letter has come from you since you
left the Philippines, but I'm sure you are
all right, because no notice has come to
me from the War Department as your
next of kin. All I know is that your regiment
is in Peking, and I hope and pray
you are with it, all safe and sound. Sister
Mary and me are pretty busy, as there
has been no one to help us with the place
since your brother died last spring. I
know your enlistment ain't up for another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
year, and it's wicked to desert, and they
would shoot you for it anyhow, and whom
the Lord loveth He chasteneth; but it does
seem kind of hard when we want you so
much at home that you have to be fighting
them poor Chinamen when I've been
sending money for their souls these thirty-seven
years. But as long as we all have
our health there ain't any real troubles I
suppose.</p>

<p class="i2">"I don't mean to find fault and you
mustn't worry about us. I'm as active
as a cricket and Mary hasn't been ailin'
any to speak of. It's been a good long
spell of dry weather, and that's good for
my rheumatism, but it wasn't very encouraging
for the crops. The mortgage on
the house and farm is due in six weeks, and
I can't get a renewal, though it's only six
hundred dollars, as you know. The bank
people is that haughty about the thing
that I don't exactly see how we can get
around them.</p>

<p class="i2">"But where there's a will there's a way,
and the Lord tempers the wind to the
shorn lamb, and if we ain't got any cash,
there's others worse off. Your uncle
Joseph is breakin' up fast, and he's ten
years younger than me. He's the last of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the tribe that's left on either side, and his
family won't have anything to spare when
he's gone. Of course it's hard to think of
losing our old place, but I'm still pretty
spry, and my black silk is good as new.
I can't just quite tell where Mary and me
will be if we leave home so soon, but you
write just the same and the postmaster
will know. You remember him, that
stumpy, light-haired Jameson that married
one of the Martins.</p>

<p class="i2">"God bless you, my poor wandering
boy.</p>

<p class="i7">Your loving</p>
<p class="right smcap">"Mother."</p>


<p class="p2">Jenkins was reading over "Shorty's"
shoulder, and several hairy faces framed
in gray blankets had edged silently
nearer.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of that?" said
a Sixth Cavalry corporal. "And here's
Saunders been givin' up the ghost without
havin' any real troubles. Now it's time
for you to brace up, and beg, borrow, or
steal the dough and shoot it along to the
old homestead. That letter was written
more'n a month ago."</p>

<p>But Saunders had turned his face away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and was a useless member of the ways and
means committee, which convened with
"Shorty" Blake as chairman. A praise-worthy
burst of philanthropic ardor subsided
when it met the cold fact that the
paymaster had not visited camp in two
months, and was not expected in Peking
before three weeks later. Investigation
revealed also that nearly all the available
cash in P Company had passed into the
hands of three expert poker players, who
were reported as being "hard as nails, and
wouldn't give a dollar to save their own
mothers from the poorhouse."</p>

<p>Saunders showed no symptoms of interest
in these endeavors, largely because
he foresaw their magnificent futility. He
was in a condition of hopeless apathy, and
beyond rereading the letter from home
now and then, made no effort to rally.
He kept a tally of the days remaining
before the foreclosure of the mortgage,
with a series of thumb-nail scratches on
the frame of his cot.</p>

<p>There were twelve days to be marked
off when "Shorty" Blake, who had been
discharged as cured, clattered into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
ward, and yelled as he leaned over
Saunders:</p>

<p>"I lost track of my dates while I was in
this gold-plated asylum, and my discharge
is due to-day, and I was figurin' my enlistment
wasn't up for another week. There's
a squad of discharged men goin' down to
Tientsin in a wagon-train to-morrow, and
I've drawn my travel pay, got my papers,
and I'm off for little old New York.
Here's where I drop off on the way an'
do what I can for your old folks in Kansas.
Got anything you want to send
them?"</p>

<p>Saunders became almost animated as he
rolled over and tried to speak in a fluttering
whisper:</p>

<p>"I ain't got any money for 'em; but tell
'em I was doin' well when you left me,
and to keep their nerve, an' I'll get back
as fast as I can. But speakin' between us,
Shorty, there's nothin' doin' for me, and
I'll be planted before you get to 'Frisco.
Maybe I've got some little trick to send
along. Wait a minute. Fish around under
the cot and find me a roll of rubber
blankets."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>The uproarious "Shorty" opened the
bundle and disclosed a jade teapot, in a
wrapping of wadded silk. It was a flawless
bit of carving, fashioned from a solid
block of imperial green jade, no more
than a pretty toy to the soldiers, who examined
it indifferently and wondered why
Saunders wished to send it to his mother.</p>

<p>"It's the last thing I've got," he explained,
"and the last present they'll ever
get from me. I think they'd like to know
I wasn't so blamed forgetful at the finish.
Just lug it along, Shorty, an' if it don't
get broke on the way, you can mail it
when you cross the country."</p>

<p>The wish and the token were a sick
man's whim to Blake, but he wrapped the
jade teapot and tucked it in a soft corner
of his haversack when he packed his kit
late that night. He was vaguely aware
that his purpose of finding the distressed
family of Saunders would not survive the
journey home, yet he had meant it when he
made the promise. He believed Saunders
as good as dead, because he had seen men
die of homesickness in the field hospitals
of the Philippines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll send his silly teapot to his folks,"
he told another discharged private of P
Company, as they climbed into a four-mule
wagon next morning; "and I'm
sorry I can't help him out, same as you
are. If the doctor would pack the poor
fool in a wagon and ship him to the sea,
he couldn't any more than die on the way,
and there 'd be a fightin' chance he'd
brace up."</p>

<p>With this farewell tribute of sympathy,
the fortunes of Private Saunders slipped
into the background among the varied
interests which occupied the attention of
the late Private Blake along his route to
Taku Bar.</p>

<p>In the hospital, Saunders continued to
let go his grip on life as gently as possible.
Tangible woe and regret had become active
agents in assisting the passive manner
of his fading away. A new major-surgeon
came up from Tientsin to assume
charge of the hospital, and he was angry
when he examined Saunders and heard
the history of the case. "That man is
dying of homesickness and worry," he
growled to the hospital corps private in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the ward; "and now he hasn't enough
vitality left in him to risk moving in an
ambulance. He'd snuff out like a candle
on the way to Tientsin, and you can't keep
him alive more than two weeks longer.
He may as well die in some comfort as
be jolted to death."</p>

<p>Much of the time in the following week
Saunders hovered along the borderland of
dreams which were not wholly disquieting,
for he had become on friendly terms with
the gilded dragons on the shadowy rafters,
and now and then they talked to him.
The sick men of P Company had been
sent back to duty, and Saunders did not
know those who had taken their places
along his aisle of the columned temple.
When he noticed them, it was to whisper
little inconsequential memories of home,
and to tell passers-by of some new discovery
gleaned from an intimate familiarity
with numberless gilded dragons that
never slept. He still noted the tally
marks on the frame of his cot, and when
he was too weak to reach them, the man
in the nearest cot scratched a cross for him
until only seven marks remained. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
letter was no longer read, but the tragedy
it told was woven through much of the
delirious talk of the patient.</p>

<p>Meantime "Shorty" Blake had been
routed with heavy loss among the canteens
and other diversions of Tientsin, and,
greatly the worse for wear, made his way
to Taku and boarded a Japanese transport
bound for Nagasaki. He went ashore
in that entertaining port with three Mexican
dollars as the melancholy remnant of
his pay and travel allowance "to the place
of enlistment," and presented his papers
to the American quartermaster stationed
in Nagasaki, who gave him an order for
transportation on the next United States
transport sailing for San Francisco.</p>

<p>Discharged Private Blake was much
disconcerted when he was informed that
no Government vessel was to stop en route
from Manila in less than two weeks, and
that he was stranded "on the beach," with
several other recent losses to the fighting
strength of the army in the Orient. A
bundle of looted silk had been exchanged
in Tientsin for bottles of astonishing
Scotch whiskey made in Shanghai, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
there was nothing else of cash value in the
light marching order of ex-private Blake.
He hired a room in a toy-like Japanese
hotel, and late that night returned without
his three Mexican dollars, but with the
perverted energy of a runaway automobile.
Charging headlong through the
dainty paper walls of the hotel rather
than be annoyed by trying to find the
door mobilized a small army of Japanese
policemen, and memory came back to
Blake when he was dragged into the
street, his haversack hurled at his head
by the agitated landlord.</p>

<p>Daylight found him very thirsty and
nervous, wandering along the edge of the
bay, waiting for a glimpse of a blue army
blouse and the tenuous hope of a small
loan. He leaned against the stone wall of
the Hatoba, with his haversack under his
tortured head, and twisted as his cheek
rubbed a hard lump beneath the canvas.
Ramming his hand into the haversack with
a peevish curse, "Shorty" pulled out a
package wrapped in wadded silk, and unrolled
a teapot of green imperial jade. A
stocky manikin of the Nagasaki police<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
was standing near, and the soldier addressed
him and the sleeping harbor without
partiality:</p>

<p>"If I didn't forget all about Jim Saunders
and his teapot, I'm a liar. An' he
must be dead an' planted by this time, an'
the old homestead gone to hell, an' nothin'
left but this looney little teapot as his last
will an' testament. I'll surely send it to
Kansas all right, tho' it ain't goin' to cheer
the old lady very much. The teapot must
be worth as much as a dollar and a
half."</p>

<p>Then the demon of thirst gripped Blake
by the throat, and the effort of swallowing
fairly shook him. He slipped the teapot
into his haversack, and to his credit
it must be told that he struggled with
temptation for several minutes. Then he
muttered weakly: "I ain't goin' to sell
it. The teapot will be all safe in hock
till I can send for it or make a strike.
Who's goin' to know the difference, anyway?
Saunders had no business to pass
away like a sick chicken, an' load me
up with this billy-be-damned piece of bric-a-brac."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>But shops and saloons were not yet
opened, and "Shorty" Blake walked
heavily along many blocks of silent
streets, his thirst more raging and insistent
as he found himself thwarted. Every
scruple vanished and he was ready to sell
the teapot for the price of a pint flask of
anything searching and fiery.</p>

<p>The rattle of rickshaw wheels made him
suddenly alert, and he stumbled toward
the sound. As he turned a corner there
was a collision, and the racing coolie in
the shafts slid on his head, while the passenger
barely saved himself from an
ugly backward fall. The Japanese officer
so nearly upset accepted the awkward
apologies of the soldier derelict and politely
asked whether he had been hurt.
"Shorty" pulled himself together and,
saluting instinctively, he spoke with
breathless haste:</p>

<p>"No, sir, no damage done, and I hope
you wer'n't shook up; but don't you want
to buy a prime jade teapot, and help out
an American soldier who's broke, an' ain't
got no other means of support? I know
it ain't worth much, bein' nothin' but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
a toy, but I need the price, whatever
it is."</p>

<p>The officer bowed as if honored by the
confidence, and replied: "It is not customary
to sell jade teapots in the streets so
early in the morning, and I am in the
hurry to arrive with my duty. But Japan
and America are so great friends since
Peking, eh? Is it not? A-h, is th-a-a-t the
jade, and from Peking, eh? I do not
know everything about jade, but there are
many good times for you in that teapot;
ha, ha! I think so. I am not so mean to
rob the honorable soldier. You will make
a borrow of this two yen&mdash;two dollars&mdash;all
right, eh? And you will take my card and
the teapot will come with you at my house
at noon hour, eh?"</p>

<p>Before the beclogged brain of "Shorty"
Blake had caught up with these directions,
the rickshaw was whisking around
a curve of the hillside, and the derelict was
left staring after, the jade teapot in one
hand, and two one-yen notes in the other.
Visions of wealth made him tingle, and he
rewrapped the treasure with reverent deliberation.
Then began another battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
with a battered fragment of a conscience,
and the voice of Saunders was so distinct
in his ear that he turned suddenly more
than once to mutter to the empty street:</p>

<p>"I'm on the edge of the shivers. It's a
bad sign when you hear voices as plain as
that. It's that baby whine of his, always
cryin', 'Ten days more an' the folks will be
homeless and starvin', an' I can't do
nothin'.'</p>

<p>"Holy smoke! I've heard that string of
dates often enough to keep track of 'em.
An' there's three more days leeway or I've
missed my count. An' me with a fortune
in this little monkey-doodle teapot, if that
Jap wasn't stringin' me."</p>

<p>From stories told later to his "bunkie"
on the transport, it is probable that
"Shorty" Blake passed through great
mental stress during the forenoon of his
second day in Nagasaki, but that this ordeal
was nothing compared with his torments
after an interview with a wealthy
dealer in curios at the home of a major of
Japanese infantry on the hill. There is
reason to believe that the discharged private
of the China Relief Expedition kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
his appointment in a fairly sober condition,
although much shaken and easily
startled. An hour later, the Japanese
officer accompanied "Shorty" Blake to the
telegraph office and the branch of the
Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, with an
air of anxious guardianship, as if determined
to see a wavering project through
to the finish. Shorty skipped references
to his escort in subsequent narratives, as
if the topic were painful, dismissing his
interview with the sweeping summary:</p>

<p>"I had to go an' put that little Jap wise
to the whole hard-luck story of Jim Saunders.
Then he talked to me like a Dutch
uncle, and had me on the mourners' bench
in no time. Them Japs is strong on filial
duty, and he never let up on me till the job
was done."</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours later, the Signal
Corps operator at the American army station
in Peking copied a message addressed
to "J. Saunders, P Company, Ninth Infantry,
Field Hospital No. 1."</p>


<p class="p2 i2">"Sold teapot for eight hundred dollars
gold. Have cabled six hundred to old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
lady to bust mortgage. Will bust Nagasaki
wide open with balance. If not dead,
brace up.</p>

<p class="i7">(Signed)</p>
<p class="right smcap">"Shorty."</p>


<p class="p2">It seemed indecent to carry this telegram
to the bedside of Private Saunders.
He had lost all interest in the world of
men and things, yet was inexplicably lingering,
as if caught in an eddy as he
drifted out. Fantasies had fled, and his
mind was clearing, as if to pay some heed
to the important business of ceasing to be.
The message was first read by the major-surgeon,
and there was more than professional
interest in his tone, as he said to the
nurse of the ward:</p>

<p>"Give that man ten drops of digitalis
and a dose of brandy, and try to wake him
up enough to understand this telegram.
It's the only thing on earth that may pull
him through. He told me his troubles,
and this ought to be his salvation."</p>

<p>The powerful stimulants stirred a current
of life in Saunders, and he heard and
comprehended the tidings from "Shorty"
Blake, and the heroic compromise of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
distressed soul who had saved the home of
his "pal," but could not let go his grip on
the remainder of the windfall. The invalid
gulped and there was almost the
shadow of a grin in his stammering
whisper:</p>

<p>"That b-b-blamed fool Shorty is a &mdash;&mdash;
angel, ain't he? I-I don't b-believe I'm
d-dead yet. Say, can I go home if I'll get
strong enough to stand the hike?"</p>

<p>This effort exhausted Saunders and he
slept awhile. The surgeon was taking his
pulse when he awoke, and the friendly
nurse holding a cup of beef tea to his
lips.</p>

<p>"You seem to have quit making an ass
of yourself," said the surgeon; "and I've
seen your company commander this afternoon.
If you can work up enough
strength to stand the trip to the coast,
I'll see that your discharge papers are
made out. You'll be no more good to the
army."</p>

<p>The same inducement had previously
failed to interest Saunders, but now he
had determined to live, in the mighty inspiration
of joy and hope renewed. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
drank beef tea and begged for more, and
when he flashed a feeble sputter of profanity
because he was not allowed a bit of
bacon, the ward became noisily cheerful.
The captain of P Company was not a
hard man, but he had suspected Saunders
of malingering until the major-surgeon
told him the private's hospital history, and
how he had been saved from death by the
miraculous intervention of the departed
and flagrantly notorious "Shorty" Blake.</p>

<p>"Saunders isn't a bad soldier," said the
captain, "but he's always been a bit too
sentimental and broody. And if he's decided
to save another funeral in the company,
you'd better ship him home before
he changes his mind. We can't feed him
on another batch of such stimulating news
if he slumps again. I'll look after his discharge
papers, if you will certify him for
disability."</p>

<p>It was three weeks later when Saunders,
very thin and somewhat wobbly,
waited in Nagasaki for the next transport
homeward bound from Manila. He met
a discharged corporal of Riley's Battery
whom he had seen in hospital, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
gunner was eager to tell a highly colored
tale whose peroration ran:</p>

<p>"And I was just in time to see the finish
of 'Shorty' Blake's bombardment of Nagasaki,
and it must have been a wonder all
the way. They took him off to the transport
in a sampan, with four little Jap
policemen sittin' on his head and chest,
and him kickin' holes in the cabin roof.
The only night I was out with him he was
playin' a game of turnin' rickshaws upside
down, and sittin' on the axle, with the
passenger yellin' murder underneath until
Shorty got ready to move on. I asked
him where he got all his money for rum
and police court fines, and he was that
twistified with booze, he says:</p>

<p>"'I ripped the mortgage off the old
homestead like the hero in a play, and
took my commissions like J. P. Morgan
reorganizin' a railroad. If you don't believe
it, ask the Jap whose name begins
with a jade teapot.'"</p>

<h2 id="CHOICE">CAPTAIN ARENDT'S CHOICE</h2></div>


<p>His wife half raised herself from
the couch which had been her
abiding place for more than
twenty years. "My broken flower," the
captain named her in his prayers at sea.
The One to whom these petitions arose
each night his liner throbbed along the
Western Ocean track had granted that
the heart and soul of the wife should wax
in strength and sweetness while her body
lay bound in chains of suffering. Because
to-night there was worry in the tired,
brave eyes which strove so well to mirror
only gladness when the captain was at
home, he was much disturbed, the more
because he had made the cloud to come.</p>

<p>She looked, indeed, like a "broken
flower" beside the towering strength of
the captain, who growled through his
flaming beard when he would speak most
softly, who moved in a series of small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
earthquakes as he tried to pace with gentlest
tread, while they thrashed out the
momentous problem.</p>

<p>"To think of the new home is wonderful,"
she said in German, for this they
talked when together. "Do the doctors
truly believe I shall be stronger if we live
at New York? Is there, indeed, hope of
health again? Ah, but it is risking all we
have saved in these twenty-five years,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The captain no longer withheld his
voice and it boomed through the little
house with a hurricane note, though he
meant it to be only reassuring:</p>

<p>"But the gain is wonderful. Such a
home as I have found last voyage&mdash;in the
country, in the hills, near New York.
There is life in the air, and it will make
you well every day. And better than that,
what is everything to you and me, I shall
be with you almost a whole week every
voyage&mdash;almost a week in a month. Now,
when I must sail from Liverpool, I am
home here in Antwerp with you perhaps
two days a month, perhaps not at all when
storm and fog delay my ship, or when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
passage is bad for the North Sea packet in
winter.</p>

<p>"The doctors say you cannot live in wet,
gloomy England, and here it is not much
better. You will get well where we are
going. We can be together as much as
when I was chief officer in the old <i>Deepdale</i>,
running out of Antwerp. The deeds
of the home are ready to sign. I pay the
ten thousand dollars when I come to New
York this voyage. Then you come out
the voyage after with me, for the company
makes for us exception to the rule
that a wife cannot sail on her husband's
vessel."</p>

<p>She wistfully smiled as if led by a beautiful
dream, thinking in her heart that to
be sure of seeing her husband so often
would be more than ever she dare hope
for. Even beckoning health must yield
first place to such a gift as this, but not
yet satisfied she asked with tremulous insistence:</p>

<p>"But the bank will send the money over
without risk, and it is all we have in the
world, dear Max. Do you remember how
the nest-egg was put away so long ago,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
when we hoped for children, and this was
to be the beginning of their fortune?
Why carry the money on your ship? Why
take it with you?"</p>

<p>"<i>Mein Gott</i>, sweetheart mine, is not the
old <i>Wasdale</i> safe as the dry land? Is not
the old vessel safer than the banks, which,
as they say in New York, bust higher as a
kite every little while? Perhaps they give
me a piece of paper worth ten thousand
dollars in Antwerp. When I dock in
New York, perhaps the bank has gebust
while I am in mid-ocean, then my paper
is worth nothing; the money is a total loss.
In the <i>Wasdale</i>, in my room, in my safe, it
is mine, and I have never lost a life, much
less ten thousand good dollars. You do
not worry when I go to sea. Am I not
worth as much as our stocking full of
gold? Answer me that, my Flora."</p>

<p>He did not know through how many
nights, when she heard the winter gales
from the North Sea cry over the roof, a
quivering agony of fear had gripped her
wide-eyed lest the <i>Wasdale</i> might have
met disaster. But experience had taught
the wife that no argument could prevail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
in which the safety and strength of the
ship were questioned. Helpless to make
reply, she accepted defeat, for the parting
hour was far gone and the separation
always taxed her fitful energy near to
breaking.</p>

<p>Always as he raised her for the last kiss,
and then halted reluctant in the doorway,
he was to her as her bright youth had first
seen him, a red viking, born to master
steel and steam instead of the galleys of
his forebears. This night he smote his
chest resoundingly before he vanished
into the hallway, and said in comforting
farewell:</p>

<p>"It is here, in the old brown wallet, next
my heart, where thou dwellest, my Flora.
Our money is soon on the old <i>Wasdale</i>.
God keep you!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The biting wind of early March fairly
whipped the captain up the side of the
liner lying, with shortened cable, mid-stream
in the Mersey. Clutching a stiff
hat with one hand, baggy trousers fluttering,
the tails of his frieze ulster tripping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
him, it was an odd and ungainly figure of
a man that gained the deck and lumbered
forward. A quartermaster near the gangway
grinned when the pot-hat bounced
from the bristling red head and carromed
merrily off the deck-house, but a glance
from the tail of Captain Arendt's eye
froze the mahogany countenance of the
offender into instant solemnity. It was
a hint that the master of the ship was
coming into his own. A few moments
later he emerged from his quarters transformed.
The smartly setting uniform of
blue and the flat cap jammed down hard
were so evidently what he belonged in,
that the shore-going clothes had been like
a clumsy disguise. A small boy flattened
himself against the rail and saluted with
immense dignity. The captain pinched
him with a hairy paw and chuckled:</p>

<p>"Hello, Moses, or vas it Josephs I calls
you last woyage? Holy Schmokes! If
you keep my room no better dis woyage,
I bites your head off close to your neck.
You hear? Scoo-o-t."</p>

<p>"Moses-Josephs" fled, and Captain
Arendt turned on his heel to go back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
his room, remembering with a start that
he had not placed the precious wallet in
his safe, but had transferred it to his
blouse. He clapped his hand to the breast
pocket, hove an explosive sigh of relief
when he found it there, and was instantly
bent on banishing all chance of loss, when
the chief engineer popped up from below
and sought him out in breathless haste
with these tidings:</p>

<p>"Sorry to trouble you, sir, but a
drunken dock-rat of a Liverpool fireman
refuses to go on watch, and he's reinforced
the argument with a slice-bar,
and laid out two of my oilers and a stoker,
and I need more help to get him in irons.
He's raising hell, and no mistake, sir."</p>

<p>The captain was halfway down the ladder
before the chief had done speaking,
and despite the bigness of him, made his
way to the fire-room like a squirrel. The
pallid, sodden mutineer, backed into a corner,
was swinging the iron bar in empty
circles, fighting the dancing shadows from
an open furnace door, cursing and muttering.
His bleary vision had no time to
focus on the big man with the red face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
and snapping blue eye, who ducked under
the weapon, smashed him in the face with
one hand, squeezed his neck in the other,
and flung him against a bunker door with
such force that he lay as he fell, a dirty,
huddled heap.</p>

<p>"Vash him off on deck, and put him in
the hospital," said the captain. "He's a
goot man ven sober. He vas vit me in
anudder ship once. I knows him. Only
his ribs is cracked, I t'ink."</p>

<p>When the five thousand ton <i>Wasdale</i>
began to crawl down the Mersey, a hundred
emigrants clustered along the after-rail,
and shivered as they chattered. Two
score cabin passengers walked the saloon
deck amidships, and watched the great
gray docks slip past. Twilight brooded
over the Irish Sea and the filmy Welsh
coast when dinner called them to make
swift acquaintance, from which the ponderous
good humor of the captain was
missing. He dined alone in his room, and
hastily, because he preferred to keep close
to the bridge in these jostling waters. Yet
the night had become almost windless, and
so clear that the twin lanterns of the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>-ship
off Carnarvon Bay gleamed like
jewels on a canopy of black velvet. Captain
Arendt leaned on the rail at the end
of the bridge, and sniffed the sparkling
air as the evening wore late.</p>

<p>"It looks goot," he muttered; "but I
schmell fog. Yes, I schmell fog, and the
rail is schticky, and the paint is schticky,
and dere will be fog before morning."</p>

<p>He rubbed a massive shoulder and
turned to the chief officer:</p>

<p>"And my rheumatism tells me dere vill
be wet fog. I am coldt, and vill change
my coat. I am also an old fool; but tell
the engine-room to stand by for fog, not
before morning, but before midnight, by
Chiminy! I schmelled it strong dot time,
and I never schmelled him wrong."</p>

<p>"Moses-Josephs" was caught in the act
of brushing and laying away the captain's
shore togs with absorbed attention to detail.</p>

<p>"Choke dot vistlin' noise off, and run
avay," was the order that sent the boy
scurrying toward the door. "Vait, I tells
you," halted him as if he had fetched up
against a wall. "How is your mudder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
boy? She was pretty sick last voyage, you
tells me. Better? Dot is fine. When we
come again to Liverpool, if you are a goot
boy, you can lay off one trip mit wages,
and help her get well. Now scoo-o-t. I
don't want you around. You is a tamned
nuisance."</p>

<p>"Moses-Josephs" ducked in thanks,
and the captain locked the door behind
him, and sat at his desk with the "old
brown wallet" before him. "I vill count
him once," he confided to the barometer,
"for fear he may have ewaporated while
I forgot him."</p>

<p>His glance fell next on the picture of
his wife, framed in silver against the wall.
As he slowly counted the rustling notes,
he talked aloud to her in German, as he
had done many times in sheer loneliness
and longing:</p>

<p>"Four hundred pounds&mdash;the first four
hundred pounds came hard, my Flora,
didn't it? Ten years we saved it while I
was fourth and third officer in the company.
One thousand pounds&mdash;we had a
grand celebration when that was landed
high and dry, eh? Fifteen hundred&mdash;it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
a grand investment this. Two thousand
pounds&mdash;it is a fine fortune, but we would
be rich with nothing."</p>

<p>The square-hewn face softened and the
flinty blue eye was misty as the captain
bundled the notes into the wallet and
stooped to open the little safe beneath the
desk. The combination, always puzzling
for him, was unusually tricky, and as he
wrestled with it the speaking tube whistled
near his ear.</p>

<p>"There's thick fog ahead, sir. We'll
be into it before long," rumbled the voice
of the chief officer from the bridge.</p>

<p>The captain hastily thrust the wallet
into the top drawer of his desk, wriggled
into a heavy reefer, and went on the
bridge. A dense belt of darkness hung
low ahead on the water and curtained the
stars. Presently this barrier strangely
streaking the clear sky was changed to
dirty, gray clouds, then into blinking mist.
Thus the fog shut down like wool.</p>

<p>The lamenting whistle of the <i>Wasdale</i>
at once began to protest against this game
of hide-and-seek. The bridge indicator
signaled "half speed," and the vessel stole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
ahead as if in nervous dread, like a blind
horse in a crowded thoroughfare.</p>

<p>Before long she began to feel her way
with frequent pauses, while those on
watch, from bridge to crow's nest, listened,
listened. Their eyes were useless;
their ears dreaded lest they hear too loud
reply to the siren that shouted over and
over again to this world of gray nothingness
that the <i>Wasdale</i> was abroad. The
ship crept ahead, slowed to listen, crept
ahead again, but the responses to her outcries
so soon became softened or silent that
they held no menace.</p>

<p>The hour was near midnight. In their
staterooms, the cabin passengers awoke to
cast sleepy abuse at the fog-horn, and turn
over again to slumber, warm and dry, believing
themselves as secure as in their
own homes. On the bridge an uncouth,
dripping specter in oil-skins suddenly
threw back his head and spun round to
face the starboard quarter as if he had
felt the sting of a bullet.</p>

<p>A moment's waiting, the fog-horn of
the <i>Wasdale</i> moaned again, and from out
in the baffling pallor came the ghost of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
reply, nearer than when last heard, louder
than when its previous warning had startled
the captain.</p>

<p>The other steamer, groping to nose a
clear path through the hazards of these
waters, steadily became more clamorous.</p>

<p>The <i>Wasdale</i> called with loud, imploring
blasts as if asking the stranger to
speak more distinctly. The chief officer
said as he glanced at the helm indicator:</p>

<p>"She's barely got steerage way now,
sir."</p>

<p>"Let her go as she is for a liddle bit," replied
the captain. "Dot feller is going up
channel, I t'ink. But vat he do heading
our way in such a devil of a hurry?" For
a deadened hoot told that the unknown
was drawing close aboard. The straining
eyes on the <i>Wasdale's</i> bridge could see not
more than two ship-lengths into the midnight
fog.</p>

<p>"It is like dot game they play in the
steerage," was the captain's whispered
comment. "Two fellers is blindfold, and
the udder sundowners make 'em chase one
anudder round the deck."</p>

<p>The warnings from beyond had as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>sumed
definite direction, as if the stranger
were guided by a fell instinct beyond the
ken of her own officers. The <i>Wasdale's</i>
siren ripped the night with quavering exhortation
to hold hard and beware.</p>

<p>Suddenly the captain gripped the
bridge rail and lifted himself on his toes
with a smothered "Gott!" that was
wrenched from the depths of his broad
chest. Two lights blinked, red and green,
almost abeam, and between them a towering
mass dead black against the shrouding
night, while amazed voices were heard
screaming a flurry of orders from the fog,
even before the roar of both whistles
sounded a belated duet.</p>

<p>Captain Arendt was at his indicator
with a leap and was like to pull the handle
from its sockets as he signaled to reverse
his engines, while his chief officer was
shouting down the tube the same momentous
summons. The third officer was
softly treading a little jig-step, in a frenzy
of impatience to have the thing done without
more suspense. The <i>Wasdale</i> groaned
and trembled to the furious reaction of
her screw, lost headway, hung helpless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and showed a fair broadside to the assault
of the other ship, which, wholly at fault,
had begun to swing in fatal blundering, as
if trying to pass under the <i>Wasdale's</i>
stern.</p>

<p>The blow came, therefore, a little abaft
the bridge. Succeeding a prodigious
crash and rending of plates came a moment
of impressive stillness, as the <i>Wasdale</i>
tried to right herself from the shock,
and then a foolish clatter of falling china
and glass.</p>

<p>"He's waltzed clean through our pantry,"
said the third officer to himself.</p>

<p>Captain Arendt had only to rise from
the planks where he had been flung, to
command a bird's-eye view of the disaster.
He looked down on the crumpled bows of
the other ship, driven twenty feet into his
own saloon-deck, and making a trumpet
of his hands, shouted across to the other
bridge, on which he could see figures moving
like agitated black smudges:</p>

<p>"You is cut us half in two. Keep going
ahead. Don't back out, vatever you do.
Keep the hole plugged until I gets my
peoples off."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>The other ship seemed to hang as if
wedged in the gap she had made, but before
the officers of the <i>Wasdale</i> could
reach the saloon deck the hideous, rending
noise was renewed. The black bows of
the stranger wrenched themselves loose,
slid clear, and with a sobbing roar the sea
rushed in as water falls over a dam. The
withdrawn mass ground alongside, tearing
woodwork into kindling, and then began
to melt softly into the fog. Captain
Arendt clambered back to his bridge,
shouting as he ran:</p>

<p>"Ship ahoy, you! You have sunk us.
Stand by to safe life. Get out mit your
boats. Blow your vistle. You pig swine
of a &mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Without reply the slayer faded like a
phantom and was gone. From far down
in the <i>Wasdale's</i> hold came a sound which
made her captain thrill to feel that discipline
had stood its first grim test. Collision
doors in bulk-heads were grinding
shut with the mutter of far-off thunder.</p>

<p>The electric lights on deck and in the
saloons had been snuffed out. The ship
was in darkness almost everywhere. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
staterooms came screams of women and
the wails of little children. The few
stewards on watch were first to join the
seamen on deck and those who had been
flung from their bunks forward by the
shock of collision. Into the ruck began to
pour firemen and coal-passers from below,
already flooded out of their compartments.
It was perhaps three minutes before
a welter of men began to flow in
eddies toward the boats.</p>

<p>Meantime a wonderful thing was being
done. The compelling personality of one
man rose dominant as if he had been given
the strength of ten. Panic was on tiptoe,
ready to make an inferno of these decks,
when it was routed because a hundred and
forty men in the <i>Wasdale</i> had learned by
the hard drill of experience that what this
man said must be done on the instant.
Captain Arendt called for light, and four
sailors came running with the globe lamps
snatched from the steerage and the wheelhouse.
He swung one of these over the
hole in the ship's side, and there was no
need to wait for the reports of those sent
below to make examination. Her bulk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>-heads
could not save her, and she was settling
fast.</p>

<p>"The old <i>Wasdale</i> vas not builded for
this," he said to the chief officer. "She will
sink in one half hour&mdash;no longer. We
must safe life. Get the men to their stations
at the boats, joost like boat-drill we
have every woyage. If they don't go,
shoot 'em. But they vill go. I knows.
Send an officer in charge of some goot
men to handle the steerage."</p>

<p>The captain passed his own cabin door
three times in the next handful of seconds.
It was only a step, only an instant
snatched from this priceless flight of time,
to save the wallet in the top drawer of the
desk. Each time he passed the door the
desire to enter pulled him as if strong
hands clutched his shoulders, but he went
on.</p>

<p>Once he hesitated, and just then a
grimy figure rushed past him headlong,
and flung itself at the falls of the nearest
boat, tearing at the canvas cover with teeth
and nails, moaning as if hurt. At his
heels came three others from below decks,
knocking down all who blocked their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
escape. The captain tore their leader
from the boat, and, like a red bear, seized
him around the waist and tossed him overboard
like a bundle of rags. Those near
heard the choking yell of a drowning man.</p>

<p>The captain turned, and for the only
time shouted at the top of his great voice:</p>

<p>"Men, the ship is in a sinking condition.
The only coward on board vas gone. To
your stations. We must all safe life."</p>

<p>A group of stokers huddled near the
rail dropped the bundles of clothing they
had brought on deck, and one of them,
whose head was bound in rags, cried back:</p>

<p>"We're wid ye. You near kilt me to-day,
you big Dutch &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, but by &mdash;&mdash;
----, you're a man. All right, sorr; we'll
go after thim dummies in th' steerage."</p>

<p>It is consistent with few narratives of
disaster at sea, but there was no more
shouting among the crew of the <i>Wasdale</i>.
They bent fiercely to their business, with
whispers and muttered directions. It was
not the nearness of death that stifled their
outcries so much as the imminent neighborhood
of a man with a stout heart and
a cool head, who had hammered iron-fisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
obedience into his crews through a stormy
lifetime at sea.</p>

<p>The <i>Wasdale</i> had cleared with three
hundred men, women, and children on
board. There were boats to hold twice
that number. It was only a question of
time in which to stow these precious cargoes,
a race with the sea which each moment
sucked the <i>Wasdale</i> lower, as her
decks sloped with a sickening list to starboard.
A minute bungled meant many
lives lost.</p>

<p>The captain seemed rather to drift than
rush from one part of the decks to another.
Going down the saloon stairway,
he found a line of stewards passing passengers
up as if they were so much baggage.
The water was in the staterooms
and washing along the alleys. Weeping
women, clad only in their night-clothes,
were shoved into cork jackets, bundled
above, handed to the waiting seamen, and
laid shivering in the boats without touching
foot to deck. After ransacking the
rooms to search out all the cabin people,
the captain returned on deck to find confusion
and some outcry where he had left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
an orderly flight to the boats. A white-faced
passenger was on his knees, arms
raised on high, his mouth contorted in
trembling and husky appeal:</p>

<p>"We are doomed, and prayer alone can
save. The ship is going down, the ship is
going down, and we must be lost forever
unless we gather in prayer. Come round
me, and let us pray together. Oh, make a
last appeal to your Maker to forgive us,
before we go to meet Him with sin-stained
souls. Man can do nothing, God can do
all. Oh, save us, save our lives, we beseech
Thee!"</p>

<p>A dozen half-naked passengers wavered,
broke away from control, and fell
around him, sobbing or trying to join in
broken prayer. The voice of the suppliant
rose to a shriek, and some of the crew
balked, as if panic were stealing among
them. Captain Arendt crashed through
the pitiful circle and thundered:</p>

<p>"Choke dot idiot performance. Let the
vimmen do the prayin'. Tumble into dot
boat, you. You vill make the devil to pay
here, I tells you. Be still!"</p>

<p>Fear had made the wretch deaf to rea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>son.
He subsided only to stagger to another
corner of the deck, where his prayers
again drew after him many who were convinced
that death was inevitable.</p>

<p>"Jam him into the boat, and set on
him," was the captain's order. "Break
him in two pieces mit an oar if he makes
one more yell."</p>

<p>Twenty minutes after the collision, the
saloon deck of the <i>Wasdale</i> was only a few
feet from the sea. The cheering creak of
the falls as they ripped through the
sheaves was sounding from one end of the
deck to the other, as the boats descended
while the captain counted them and held
his breath, lest some unlooked-for lurch
of the helpless ship should crush them
against her sides like so many egg-shells.
Were all hands out? He did not know,
but it was time to leave. Some one jogged
his elbow, and he turned to see little
"Moses-Josephs," who said with trembling
lip:</p>

<p>"I'm all ready to go when you are, sir.
Anything more I can do? I took care of
the stewardess and her cat, sir."</p>

<p>"Joost run to my room quick, and get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the pocket-book in the top&mdash; No, stay
here mit me. Yump into Number T'ree
boat this minute, you liddle nuisance."</p>

<p>"I cannot let him go," groaned the captain,
"and risk the child be drownded.
Vat his sick mudder say to me if he don't
come back?"</p>

<p>Surely there was time for the captain
to rush up to his room, only half the length
of the deck, and rescue the savings of his
long life at sea. The wistful, troubled
face of the wife as he had last seen her, the
hope of home and health, fairly drove him
to run forward with head down. He
looked overside as he ran, and the gray
sea was lipping so close that he could have
touched it from the deck below. The
planks under his feet rolled once with
a weary, sluggish heave. He had once
been in a sailing vessel which foundered
in such a smooth sea as this, and he recalled
that just before she plunged under
there had been a series of these long
labored rolls as if the ship were gasping
for breath before the sea should wholly
smother her.</p>

<p>He had almost gained the ladder to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
bridge when he saw a moving blotch of
white almost hidden behind the bow of a
disabled boat. Swerving, he found a
woman, a little girl, and a man, plainly
their husband and father. The man was
leaning over the rail, trying to call to the
nearest boat, which was warily pushing
away from the sinking ship. Spasms of
fear so clutched his throat that his cries
were only whispers, as one shrieks without
voice amid nightmare perils. The woman
clung to his coat, the little girl to her
mother's garment. Evidently they had
been overlooked because of the hiding
place to which the man had blindly led
them. As the captain reached the rail,
the man tore himself loose from his wife
and child with a great cry, and plunged
headlong overside, not into the sea, but
into the boat, which, at great risk, had
been pulled close to save the group. With
a crash, he smote the metal gunwale and
fell inboard.</p>

<p>"Did you caught that dirty loafer?"
shouted the captain.</p>

<p>The voice of the fourth officer in charge
of the boat bellowed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir; but I think he's dead as a
mackerel. He landed square on his head;
and one of the men who's picking him up
says his neck is broken. Shall we stand
by?"</p>

<p>"Holy Schmokes, yes. Sving that lantern
so you can see to caught the voman
first."</p>

<p>It was not an easy task. Another uneasy
roll of the deck told him that the
<i>Wasdale</i> was in the death throes. The
water lapped through the scuppers as she
lurched back and down to port. There
were only a few steps to the bridge, the
room, and the old brown wallet. He
worked with furious haste. The mother
had sunk to the deck, fainting and inert.
She had seen her husband desert her on a
sinking ship; she had heard of his death
below. Her arms had locked around the
waist of the child, hardly more than a
baby, whose wisp of a night-dress was
tattered about its neck. The captain
tugged at the mother's hands to free the
child, for he dare not toss them over thus
embraced.</p>

<p>Each second imperiled the lives of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
three, and also the fate of the ten thousand
dollars that "was safer in the old
<i>Wasdale</i> than in the bank ashore." At
length the captain wrapped the child in
his reefer, and tossed her into the waiting
boat with a warning shout. The mother
was a wrenching weight to swing clear,
but when she had followed, a cheer from
the boat told him that she had been safely
caught.</p>

<p>He wiped the sweat and mist from his
purpling face, and muttered:</p>

<p>"I must safe life; I must safe life, my
Flora, as long as she floats."</p>

<p>The <i>Wasdale</i> still floated, as if the old
ship were prolonging the struggle in order
that the master who loved her might
yet save the fortune that meant so much
to him. He picked up a life-preserver
thrown aside on deck, slipped into it, and
looked around him, now desperately bent
on reaching the bridge, even though the
ship should sink beneath him. Surely
none else than he was left on board.</p>

<p>A blob of light flickered far aft on deck&mdash;a
globe lamp such as the sailors had been
working with. He saw it, and caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
hold of an awning stanchion to steady
himself. It must be only a sailor dutifully
standing by, before getting away in the
last boat. Surely he could take care of
himself. Was it not enough that he, the
captain, should have done all that could
be expected of mortal man, more than almost
any other commander had ever done,
to save his passengers and crew, hundreds
of them, from a ship run down and sunk
in half an hour? Was he not justified, in
sight of God and man, in saving his fortune,
not for himself, but for the helpless
wife at home? It was all they had, on it
was builded all they hoped for. He
swayed in his tracks, as the warring motives
pulled him this way and that.</p>

<p>"Oh, my wife," he gasped. "I must be
the last man to leave the ship, or I must go
down mit her. I cannot, no, by Gott, I
cannot go to my room."</p>

<p>He fled aft as if the devil had tried to
snare his soul. The sea caught at his heels
as he ran, even on deck. Aft of the steerage
deck-house, the lamp he had glimpsed
was dancing in crazy circles, where two
firemen were struggling with a heap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
of Hungarian emigrants, who violently
refused to help themselves. One of
the would-be rescuers, whose head was
bound in rags, spoke as the captain drew
near:</p>

<p>"Don't hit me agin, sorr. Me ribs is
stove in, an' I can't be handlin' these
loony Dagoes in proper style. We
had 'em all in the boat, sorr, but they
swar-r-med back unbeknownst after their
filthy bundles of duffle."</p>

<p>The emigrants were, indeed, difficult to
pry loose from their huge packages of
clothing, and as the disabled fireman was
of little use in the pitched battle raging,
his comrade was unable to wrest himself
free of the frenzied men whom he was
trying to save. The great strength and
weight of the captain piled into the tangled
mass like a battering ram, and one
by one the reinforced firemen pitched the
foreigners overboard to be fished out by
the boat that lingered perilously under
the counter.</p>

<p>"Yump yourselves!" yelled the captain;
and as they dove, the stern of the <i>Wasdale</i>
reared and seemed to be climbing sky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>ward.
Her commander cast one hungry
glance toward the bridge, and saw her
bows vanish in a smother of foam. As he
jumped, he felt a shudder, as if every
plate was drawing from its rivets. When
his head rose on the crest of a roller, a
boat-hook was twisted into his shirt, and
he was yanked inboard by half a dozen
hands, while the seamen bent to the sweeps
for life or death as they strove to pull beyond
reach of the coming suction.</p>

<p>The boat was not more than a hundred
yards astern when the <i>Wasdale</i> pitched
again, rolled once, and vanished with a
thunderous farewell as her decks blew up
in clouds of hissing steam.</p>

<p>As if the killing fog had waited for this
sacrifice, it began to lift until the scattered
lights in the eight boats began to flock together
and the flotilla lay waiting for
daybreak. The captain knew not whether
any souls had been left on board, and miserably
impatient he longed for light to
count them.</p>

<p>"It is a bad night's vork," he said to the
bos'n at the tiller. "I haf lost my ship,
and I may never get anudder. I haf lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
all my money, and I vill not get him again,
for I am too old. But I hope I haf safed
all my peoples, and if dot is so, I tank
Gott."</p>

<p>Before day came their rockets were answered,
and a big steamer loafed sluggishly
toward the clustered life-boats.
When she hove to, it was apparent that
she had been in collision. Her bows were
jumbled back to her fore bulkhead, and
it seemed a miracle that she had been kept
afloat.</p>

<p>"It is the svine vat runned into us," said
the captain, "and den runned avay. I vish
a few vords mit her skipper."</p>

<p>When the crew of the <i>Wasdale</i>, scrambling
up the Jacob's ladders, had hoisted
the bruised and benumbed passengers
aboard, the crippled vessel limped on her
course toward Liverpool. She was an
Italian tramp, inbound from South
American ports, and her captain had a
taste of regions even more torrid when
interviewed on his bridge by the late commander
of the <i>Wasdale</i>, who returned
aft to find his people vainly trying to find
shelter from the cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why aren't dose poor miserable vimmen
in the cabins?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The cabins are all locked, sir," replied
one of the men, "and the Dago cook won't
let us in the galley to get something to
eat."</p>

<p>"Break open the cabin doors, and pitch
the Eyetalian swab out on his dirty head,
and cook whatefer you find in this schow,"
was the order, and these things were done
on the instant. Coffee and hash were
made by the <i>Wasdale's</i> cooks, and passed
by the <i>Wasdale's</i> stewards, and the invaded
cabins ransacked for whatever
blankets and clothing might serve to
warm the pitiable castaways.</p>

<p>A little later the crew of the <i>Wasdale</i>
was mustered for roll call. Each department
rallied to its chief. As down the
lines of shivering men the "Here, sir," ran
without a gap, the captain found himself
choking back the tears, for at the same
time the purser made tally of the cabin
and steerage passengers, and found all
present, even to the silent figure under a
tarpaulin of the man who had slain himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>The crew cheered, and the chief engineer
stepped forward and began:</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, captain, but when we remember
the <i>Elbe</i> and the <i>Bourgogne</i>, we
have a right to think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The captain silenced him with a gesture
and left them. Now, first he could think
of his own crushing disaster, which, in his
thoughts, eclipsed the great deliverance he
had wrought by grace of his own courage
and loyalty. He did not see that he had
done anything to merit praise, rather was
his plight almost worse than if he had
gone down with the <i>Wasdale</i>. Brooding
and unnerved, he did not rouse himself
until the battered tramp was in the Mersey,
and then he sent a tug ashore with
tidings for his company, bidding them
meet and succor his helpless people.</p>

<p>The melancholy procession had filed
ashore before he gripped his resolution,
and, coatless and ragged, sought his superintendent
to make report of what had
happened. This interview was brief, for
the formal investigation must wait the
captain's written word. The superintendent
was also a man among men, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
was silent for a little time, looking at the
bowed figure of the captain, who sat with
his tousled red head in his hands, thinking
now of the telegram he must send to Antwerp.
A few broken words had told the
superintendent of the wife and the old
brown wallet.</p>

<p>Finally the captain wrote this message:</p>



<p class="i2 p2"><i>I have lost my ship and all our money,
but saved every soul on board.</i></p>


<p class="p2">He handed this to the superintendent,
whispered, "Please send it to her," and
started to go out of the office, he scarcely
knew whither. The superintendent halted
him, grasping the bruised right hand that
hung all nerveless.</p>

<p>"You have much to live for, Captain
Arendt, and more to be proud of. Don't
think for one moment that the company
will forget a man who can do such a
night's work as you have put to your
credit. You take my unofficial word for
it, this is a cloud with a silver lining."</p>

<p>Shortly before Captain Arendt was
ready to take train that night for the Har<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>wich
boat to Antwerp, a telegram was
handed him. He read it with a smile such
as made his haggard face seem beautiful:</p>


<p class="p2 2"><i>What care I, if thou hast saved thine
honor and thyself? Come to me.</i></p>

<p class="right"><i>Flora.</i></p>

<h2 id="OFF">SURFMAN BRAINARD'S "DAY OFF"</h2></div>


<p>Ashley Brainard left the
life-saving station and lounged
across the wide beach on which
the cadenced breakers tumbled green and
white. Beyond the gentle surf the Gulf
Stream dyed the sleeping sea deep turquoise.
The curving coast line wavered
in the glare of sunlight fierce as midsummer,
and the little landward breeze was
warm and fragrant. Barefooted, clad in
a sleeveless jersey and a frayed pair of
white ducks, Brainard dug his toes in the
wet sand and stood scowling at an automobile
that moved swiftly up the beach.
He seemed to resent its jarring intrusion
upon the brooding peace of the tropical
landscape as if a personal grudge were
involved. In truth he was angry with
himself that he could not smother the sudden
discontent born of the sight of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
drumming, flamboyant chariot which had
swooped down from the big hotel five
miles to the northward. When the car
became a swerving speck and then vanished
beyond a feathery clump of cabbage
palms, the youth turned back to the station
muttering:</p>

<p>"Now that Tarpon Inlet has closed up,
I suppose we'll be pestered to death with
these silly tourists. But, whew! it was like
getting letters from home to see my kind
of people again. I'd forgotten what they
looked like."</p>

<p>The lusty surfman rubbed his tousled
head as was his habit when restless or perplexed,
and focused his irritation on the
red-roofed cottage in which hitherto he
had found contentment.</p>

<p>"This life-saving business in Florida is
all tommy-rot. Here it is the middle of
winter, no ice and sleet, no storms, nothing
you ever read about to fit in with this
game. I'm due to take a day off and get
away from it."</p>

<p>He flung himself into the house, past
the surf-boat that filled the lower floor,
and climbed to the airy living-room above.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Jim Conklin, mending a cast-net on the
piazza, called cheerfully:</p>

<p>"You don't look happy, Boy. I thought
you'd be glad to see some of your gilt-edged
pals again. Did they try to borrow
money from you, or did they make fun of
your clothes?"</p>

<p>Brainard growled with an air of petulance
absurdly boyish for the fine-conditioned
bigness of him:</p>

<p>"I'm tired of shooting life-lines across
a pole stuck in the sand and pulling my
back-rivets loose in the boat after imaginary
wrecks. It's mostly dress rehearsal
in this shack. And we sit around and tell
each other the same old hard-luck stories
until I'm going daffy."</p>

<p>Conklin's weather-beaten face twitched
and a little protesting gesture showed that
he was hurt. Commander of a big passenger
steamer at forty, he had piled her
ashore in a fog three years before, and the
iron law of his calling had thrown him "on
the beach" without another chance. Offered
a berth as watchman on the company's
dock, he could not bring himself
to this degradation even for bread and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
butter, and he had come to the surface
again as one of the Tarpon Inlet crew.</p>

<p>Brainard saw his thoughtless blunder
and quickly added:</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that, old man. You
know how much I wish I could help you
get on your feet again. Forgive me,
won't you? I haven't any real troubles.
Only a frost-bitten pineapple patch that
was going to make my fortune. But it
will be bearing again in two years, and
then I'll be on velvet. Those gay visitors
made me a bit restless, that's all, just as
you walk the beach for hours after a Morgan
liner passes close in shore."</p>

<p>Bearded Fritz Wagenhals, the station-keeper,
broke in with a sardonic chuckle:</p>

<p>"It is the same way when we haf canned
sausage for dinner. I think myself back
in Heidelberg already, where I haf taken
my university degree twenty years ago.
What is the matter mit you, Boy? Was
it the homesickness?"</p>

<p>"No-o, not exactly," confessed Brainard
with a slightly embarrassed smile,
"but I seem to be the only one of the three
of us who can lift the curtain and get a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
peep at what he used to be. It's my day
off, and with your permission, Skipper
Wagenhals, I'm going to break my vows
and trail up to the gorgeous Coquina
Beach Hotel for dinner. It sounds rash,
doesn't it? No sign of bad weather, is
there?"</p>

<p>The Keeper replied with a shade of
doubt:</p>

<p>"The barometer is not so conservative
as I would like to see him, and we are very
due to catch a norther already. But I
don't think the weather will break before
next day or to-morrow. You haf been a
good boy, and you will haf your fling."</p>

<p>Brainard hauled a steamer-trunk from
beneath his cot and began to toss out apparel
which had been hidden therein for
two long years. He held up a dinner coat
and caressed it, rubbed a pair of patent-leather
ties with a bunch of cotton waste,
and made obeisance to a crackling shirt-bosom.
Memories crowded back, and the
smash of his high hopes of fortune was
forgotten. Ashley Brainard was among
his own again, a famous stroke of the
'varsity eight, counting a host of young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
men and maidens among his friends and
admirers.</p>

<p>His mad impulse sent a flutter of excitement
through the station. The surfmen
crowded around and were eager to
help their butterfly emerge from his
cocoon. Fritz Wagenhals said, as he
picked up the shirt with reverent care:</p>

<p>"It is a privilege if you allow me the
buttons to put in. I once wore him every
night. My Gott, that was so long ago!
Also it is good manners here to eat mit
your knife, but not so at the Coquina
Beach Hotel."</p>

<p>The bustle aroused lanky Bill Stebbins,
who was sleeping outside in the sand.
He hurried in to offer aid and counsel:</p>

<p>"Dad burn it, I was onst sheriff o' Dade
County, Brainard, an' I reckon I got a
right smart pull yit. If you git pinched
foh diso'derly conduct, raise a yell, an'
I'll come a-runnin'."</p>

<p>When Brainard announced that he had
no intention of dressing in the station the
disappointment was so evident that he
yielded to the clamor, and consented to
array himself for what Fritz Wagenhals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
called "a little drill, to see if you are all-ship-shape-put
together, mit your standin'
riggin' taut."</p>

<p>These embarrassments delayed the departure
until late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>In his one decent suit of blue serge,
which had been lovingly pressed by the
station cook, Brainard swung his luggage
as if it were as light as his heart. He
turned once to look at the red-roofed station
nestling close to the sand-dunes, and
for a moment felt as if he were playing
the traitor to those loyal big-hearted comrades
of his. Every one of them had
fought with adverse fortune, and, beaten
back, met the odds with smiling faces.
He was the youngest of the crew and the
pineapple plantation would yet release
him from his chosen bondage. On this
"day off" he ought to be back in the clearing
by the lagoon, "bossing" his one laborer,
but he looked ahead, and his young
blood thrilled at the thought of glimpsing
his own world again.</p>

<p>Northward from the station the coast
swept seaward in a bold curve which ended
in a low point over which the breakers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
played in spring-tides. Just beyond the
Point, Brainard came to the Inlet and
crossed, dry-shod, the passage between
ocean and lagoon which had carried a ten-foot
channel three months before. Now
he could see, three miles to the northward,
the long pier and the clustered roofs of
the great hotel buildings. He had often
come thus far on patrol, but had always
gazed at the glittering resort as forbidden
ground until he should regain his rightful
place among these pleasure-seekers.</p>

<p>Soon he passed through a noble avenue
arched with palms, and came to lawns that
almost lipped the sea. After the smarting
dazzle of sand and ocean, this lush,
green vista was like cold water to a thirsty
man. Parties of golfers were drifting
across the background; white and fluffy
gowns gleamed in the shrubbery. But
when the wayfarer advanced to the long
hotel piazza the smartly voluble groups
of men and women made him unexpectedly
timorous. Obtaining a room, he
slipped through the crowded and colorful
corridor to the nearest elevator, oblivious
that more than one woman turned to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
after the stalwart youth whose handsome
face was so darkly burned and whose
wholesome vigor was no veneer laid on
after a wearing season in club-land.</p>

<p>Brainard felt more like himself when
he was dressed and had tenderly absorbed
the cocktail whose perfections had haunted
his long walk. He swung into the dining-room
as if he owned it, and chose a table
facing the doors where he could view the
grand entrance of the actors in this extravaganza.
Three young women near
him were chattering of spring flittings to
Lenox and Westchester, and of summer
pilgrimages to Newport and abroad. He
heard familiar names of people he had
once known. Soon a hand fell upon his
shoulder and he looked up to see the
chubby face of his classmate "Toodles"
Brown, who fairly roared:</p>

<p>"By all the gods! It <i>is</i> Ashley Brainard.
You dear old fool! Have you been
dead or in jail or did you just float in
with the tide? Of course I'll sit down. I
haven't seen you since we sailed my
schooner for the Atlantic Cup three summers
ago. Explain yourself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>Brainard held the hand that had
gripped his and gazed with speechless joy
into the beaming features of "Toodles"
Brown. Then the surfman grinned as he
said:</p>

<p>"Good old Toodles! Why, I have a
cottage just down the beach beyond the
Point. I'm too darned exclusive to mix
up with this herd of get-rich-quick millionaires
and gilded loafers like your fat self."</p>

<p>"Living down the beach in a cottage,"
gasped Mr. Brown. "I've been here two
seasons and I swear I know every cottager
on the island. I think you're a blessed old
liar. Tell me all about yourself, Ashley.
You've given us all the cold shake, you
know."</p>

<p>Brainard explained with a boyish laugh:</p>

<p>"Well, you know I was down here
shooting through Christmas vacation of
Senior year, and I got the pineapple bee
in my bonnet. There were millions in it,
on paper. But Dad wanted me to cuddle
down at a desk in town. I stood it for
a year and you remember how I cussed.
Then I said, 'The glad free life under the
palms for mine,'&mdash;bucked clean over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
traces, and bolted. I was beginning to
dream of counting my coin, when one
night in January the thermometer slid
three degrees too low, and, bang, what a
difference in the morning! It was a case
of pineapple frappé. I was almost broke,
but I couldn't throw up the sponge, and
last fall there was an opening at Uncle
Sam's life-saving station for a strong lad
used to fussing around the water. And
there I am drawing my little old forty a
month and proud of it, until my new crop
comes in. But, oh, Toodles, I <i>am</i> glad to
see you, and for Heaven's sake, tell me all
the news about everybody! I never could
write letters. And I'm a God-forsaken
exile."</p>

<p>Chubby Mr. Brown was too agitated to
think of gossip as he blurted:</p>

<p>"You're clean crazy, plumb dippy. Let
me stake you till your ship comes in loaded
with pineapples. Ash, come back with
me. I'm planning a six months' cruise to
the Mediterranean, and I've simply got
to have you. It's sandy of you and all
that, but it's silly pride to think you must
bury yourself down here until you win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
out. Let the cunning little pineapple
plants work for you while you come back
where you belong. You a life-saver! It's
absurd!"</p>

<p>"They are all better men than I in our
crew," said Brainard slowly, "and it's a
clean, simple, husky life, and I never was
so fit. But&mdash;well, I wish I hadn't taken
this day off. It hurts a little to mix up
with this sort of thing. No, I can't borrow
money, even from you. To-night I
go back to my cot and corn-beef hash.
But let's go it while the evening's young."</p>

<p>This suggestion made Mr. Brown
brighten and take heart. After dinner
they strolled on the quarter mile of piazza
facing the moonlit sea, and the scent of
tropical flowers hung heavy around them.
"Toodles" Brown was anxious to have
Brainard meet what he called "the youth
and beauty of our set," but his chum
asked him to walk first as far as the beach.</p>

<p>The pier was almost deserted, for the
wind was rising and a fine spray filled the
air with chilling dampness. Brainard
looked at the sky with a surfman's interested
scrutiny. The moon was dodging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
among fast-driving clouds and the surf
was beginning to boom on the beach with
a heavy, sullen note. He recalled the station-keeper's
warning of a "norther," but
dismissed it because the lonely red-roofed
cottage seemed half a world away. Silent
for a little while, when he spoke it was
with odd and painful effort:</p>

<p>"Have you&mdash;have you heard anything
of Marion Shaw? I&mdash;I m-mean Mrs.
Westervelt? Is she well and&mdash;and
happy?"</p>

<p>Brown chewed his cigar for a moment
before he responded:</p>

<p>"That is just what I hoped you might
want to talk about when we came out here
by ourselves, Ashley. I didn't want to
open the subject, you know. Yes, I saw
her just before she sailed for Italy two
months ago. She went alone, old man.
Westervelt's a beast. I don't know what
she went through with him, but they've
made a clean break of it for good. She
didn't confide in me to any extent. But
we talked old times, and after a while,
well, she asked me about you, and I had
nothing to tell her. I didn't even know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
where you were. And&mdash;hem&mdash;she wasn't
looking at me at all, and she wasn't even
talking to me when she said as if she were
thinking out loud:</p>

<p>"'I'm so lonely. Oh, if I could see him
just once!'"</p>

<p>Brainard leaned over the railing and
stared into the troubled sea as he almost
whispered:</p>

<p>"Is she going to get a&mdash;get a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, after waiting two years. Then
she'll be free to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you're going to the Mediterranean
in the spring?" muttered Brainard.
"God, if I could only see her! Two years,
you say? If I could only see her!"</p>

<p>Brown laid an arm across his chum's
big shoulder and said coaxingly:</p>

<p>"You don't want to meet any of these
girls to-night, do you? We'll have a good
old talk in my rooms later, and I'll have
you booked for my cruise before we part
company. There's a gilded temple of
chance back here on the lagoon where the
little ball rolls round and round, and I
have a strong hunch that the luck is running
to the black, and also dallying with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
my pet numbers, fourteen-seventeen-twenty
down the middle row. Let's
amble over and see what's doing in the
roulette mart."</p>

<p>Brainard welcomed the diversion, for
his thoughts were all upheaved. When
they entered the "Casino," the busy green
tables, the rattle of ivory chips, and the
tingling excitement pervading the eager
throng of men and women awoke in the
exile a gambling passion that had long
lain dormant. Without conscious act he
found himself fingering his little roll of
bills while he watched "Toodles" Brown
buy a staggering pile of five-dollar chips.
Fighting with his desire, Brainard idly
chose numbers here and there, and trembled
when he saw his empty choices winning
time after time.</p>

<p>The whirr of the ball as it sped round
the edge of its gleaming disk, lost headway,
hesitated for a heart-breaking instant
and fell into its destined compartment,
was fascinating beyond words.
Presently a florid dowager withdrew with
a gesture of peevish disappointment, leaving
vacant a seat near the middle of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
table. "Toodles" Brown was profoundly
absorbed in his own gloomy run of luck,
and paid no heed to Brainard's modest investment
of twenty-five counters worth a
dollar each.</p>

<p>The life-saver had little expectation of
winning. This was a distraction, an excitement,
a part of his rare "day off," and
he hung breathless on the surging uncertainty
of every play. He noticed that
"Toodles" Brown had forsaken his "pet
numbers down the middle row," and with
a reckless impulse he placed five dollars
on each of the trio. The croupier gathered
in the stake as callously as if a large part
of a surfman's monthly wage had not
been lost in this heady plunge.</p>

<p>"I think a zero is about due, and
it stands for my prospects all right,"
thought Brainard as he slid five chips into
the space around the "single 0."</p>

<p>The purring ball was uncommonly coy,
and Brainard felt his heart thumping
while it wavered undecided. When it nestled
into its chosen nook, the croupier sung
out:</p>

<p>"The single 0 has it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>He pushed a hundred and eighty dollars
in chips toward Brainard. The young
man flushed through his tan. A wild hope
had flared in his heart. He resumed his
play with tautened nerves and a softened
light in his frank eyes. Belated luck must
fall along the "middle row" he thought,
and he covered Brown's "pet numbers"
with chips, in the squares, on the dividing
lines and in the corners. "Seventeen"
won, and he gathered in his spoils without
trying to count them. Then he threw his
chips at random, on numbers and on
colors, and the blind goddess was strangely
kind almost with every turn of the
wheel.</p>

<p>"Toodles" Brown ceased playing and
looked at his chum wide-eyed. Brainard
was exchanging some stacks of chips for
bills, and others for chips of higher values,
until he was staking the limit allowed on
a number.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake call it off!" whispered
Brown. "It can't last any longer.
Pull out while you're ahead, and let me
count it for you. You've nearly two thousand
here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>Brainard brushed him aside and feverishly
sputtered:</p>

<p>"Don't bother me. I'm playing for the
biggest stake in the world. This is my
day."</p>

<p>He snatched a fat roll of yellow-backed
bills from Brown, and tossed it across the
table to the splotch of red. Presently the
croupier droned:</p>

<p>"Twenty-four wins, and the red."</p>

<p>The cashier counted Brainard's stake,
piled up bills of equal value and shoved
the bundle across the table. With tears
in his voice Brown begged him to quit as
Brainard made one more winning plunge
and turned to his friend with a hoarse
cry:</p>

<p>"I'm through. Damn it, come on!
Let's count the plunder. I've won my
freedom."</p>

<p>A few moments later Brainard divided
somewhat more than five thousand dollars
into two rolls and stuffed them into his
trousers pockets. As the two young men
passed out of doors, they were startled by
the uproar of the wind. The palm crests
were whipping to tatters with sibilant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
lament, and the air was filled with their
flying fragments. From the beach came
the great call of a raging surf and the
sting of spray driven inland. Once, during
his cyclonic hours in the "Casino,"
Brainard had heard the rising storm cry
over the roof, but its summons had been
unheeded. It had vaguely reminded him
of duty, but even now he thought only of
his lawless wealth as he strode toward the
beach while "Toodles" Brown galloped
clumsily in his wake.</p>

<p>When they passed beyond the sheltering
lee of the last hotel building, the might
of the "norther" buffeted them breathless.
Brainard staggered out to the pier and
clutched the nearest railing lest he be
blown overboard. The rain of spray was
drenching his evening clothes as Brown
tugged at his coat and strove to pull him
toward the hotel.</p>

<p>"Let me cool off," shouted Brainard
above the tumult. "I'm going home with
you, I tell you, Toodles. I'm going to the
Mediterranean with you. I'm going to
Italy with you, God bless her! I'm going
back where I belong, and the pineapples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
can go to hell. There's five thousand in
my clothes."</p>

<p>Brown thumped him on the back and
roared:</p>

<p>"Of course you are, and you deserve
your luck. But if you love me, come out
of this. I'm a wet rag and you're worse."</p>

<p>For reply Brainard fought his way out
along the railing of the pier, and gloried
in the night. It matched his own mood.
Like the sea, he had broken the bonds that
for so long had held him tamed and stagnant.
He was drunk with the wine of
life, and the storm could not drag his
whirling thoughts back to the red-roofed
station beyond the Point.</p>

<p>Then the helpless Brown yelled in his
ear:</p>

<p>"Turn around, Ash. Over here to the
north'ard. Great Scott, what can we do?"</p>

<p>Brainard jumped to the note of alarm
in the appeal. The moonlight still spattered
across the white-fanged water.
Driving along southward, close in shore,
they saw a schooner, now a somber blotch,
now outlined against the smother that
flung itself at her. She seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
coming head on for the pier. The picture
seared itself into Brainard's very soul. It
hurled him back from his glad world regained
to the station where he ought to be.
But he waited to see if she could clear the
pier. In an agony of impatience he
crawled out where the sea was breaking
clean over the structure, far beyond where
Brown dared to follow.</p>

<p>He watched the doomed vessel wallow
as she fled before the "norther," watched
her lunge past the end of the pier, hardly
more than a hundred yards away. By the
rifting moonlight he could see that her
decks were a tangle of wreckage, her
headsails gone or flying in ribbons. She
was pelting straight down the coast, helpless
to claw off shore, helpless to heave to.</p>

<p>This was what Brainard realized as he
groaned:</p>

<p>"She's heading straight for the Point,
and she can't be handled to clear it. Or
they may be hoping to fetch the Inlet and
get inside, and they don't know it's choked
up."</p>

<p>As he ran toward the beach, Brainard
wondered how he could have forgotten.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Why had not the first note of the storm
called him home?</p>

<p>He waved a wild gesture of farewell to
his friend, and tore down the boardwalk
promenade, past the great hotel whose
hundreds of windows were ablaze with
light. Inside he glimpsed many dancers,
and an eddying gust picked up the strains
of the orchestra and brought faintly to
him the taunting sweetness of a waltz
song, "Love Comes Like a Summer
Sigh."</p>

<p>It was Surfman Brainard of the Tarpon
Inlet Station that plunged off the
end of the walk into clogging sand, for
the tide had covered all the beach, and he
must toil up as far even as the gullied
dunes. He kicked off his hampering
patent-leather ties, threw his coat after
them, and limped over driftwood and
gnarled palmetto roots, falling, scrambling,
swearing in a frenzy of eagerness
to join his comrades. The sand whirled in
blinding drifts, and he rubbed his eyes to
look for the laboring schooner which vanished
in a little while as if she were blotted
out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>He remembered that somewhere a road
led back into the tangled live-oak and
palmetto hammock beyond the sand-hills.
With a shout of joy he dove through a
gash in the tufted hillocks, and his bare
feet found a wagon track in firmer
ground. Now the storm wailed overhead,
but in darkness that was almost rayless it
twisted limbs from the tortured trees and
tossed them in Brainard's path; it flung
the meshed creepers across his way to trip
him headlong.</p>

<p>"She's bound to fetch up a long way
this side the station," he grunted, "and
the patrol may be at the other end of his
beat. And those poor devils can't live
long in the sea that's smashing over the
Point."</p>

<p>Then he thanked God for the fitness of
wind and limb which had come of long
months of hardy drill and plain living, for
the Inlet was just ahead as he came out on
the roaring beach. He looked seaward
for a rocket, and shoreward for a signal
from the patrol. No light showed anywhere
in the gray night.</p>

<p>He splashed across the tide-swept bar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
and when the bones of an ancient wreck
loomed close by, he knew he was within
a mile of home. A dark smudge moved
against the white sand-hills, and he fell
into the arms of Jim Conklin on patrol.</p>

<p>"Schooner's coming ashore," gasped
Brainard. "She passed the head pier,
heading straight down and helpless. She
was in distress for fair. If she hasn't
come this far, she's piled up on the Point.
I'll go to the station while you find her
and signal us."</p>

<p>Conklin said not a word, but made a
bull-like lunge against the storm. When
Brainard had roused out the crew, Fritz
Wagenhals shouted:</p>

<p>"Our boat is no good for us on the
Point. Get out mit the gun."</p>

<p>Six men and the cook stormed up the
beach with the life-gun and tackle, and as
they toiled through the heavy sand in the
teeth of the wind, Brainard was near collapse.
But he rallied when they crept out
toward the Point, and a red Coston light
sputtered and flared ahead. Then Jim
Conklin ran back to them waving his torch
and crying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's in the breakers on the weather
side of the Point. The Boy guessed right.
Breaking up fast, she is. Hustle up the
gun."</p>

<p>When they sighted the stranded schooner
even Brainard, who had foreseen her
plight, was amazed at the quick fury of
her destruction. The black lump of her
hulk lay in a surf which broke sheer over
it, and the stump of her mainmast rolled
in appealing gestures to the sky. The
first shot was fired dead against the wind,
and the line fell short. A second and a
third failed, and they did not even know
whether life was aboard the wreck. At
last a quartering shot sent the line across
the schooner, and there came feeble
twitches, electric pulsations that sent their
message to the men ashore as if hands had
been clasped across the boiling inferno of
white water.</p>

<p>The wreck was breaking up fast. Her
timbers strewed the beach, and drifted
menacingly in the surf. But with slow,
halting effort, the whip-line followed the
slender cord of the projectile, and after
that the heavy hawser trailed out into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
night until the jerky signal came ashore
that all was made fast. The surfmen
tailed on and the breeches-buoy was
dragged shoreward. At length a sodden
shape, coughing and groaning, was
pulled up on the sand by the men who
rushed among the combers. Four more
trips the breeches-buoy made, and three
more sailors were fetched ashore alive.
The last of these was asked how many
were left aboard and he gasped:</p>

<p>"Nobody but the skipper, an' he's
hangin' on by his toenails."</p>

<p>On shore they waited in vain for a signal,
and none came. It was more ominous
when the hawser slackened. It was
read as a death-warrant when the hawser
yielded to the tautening heave of the surfmen,
yielded with sickening ease and came
washing and writhing in to them, hand
over hand, broken adrift from the wreck.
The little group on the thundering beach
stared across the ghastly water at the dissolving
lump of the schooner, knowing by
instinct that it would be foolishly futile to
shoot another line seaward. They waited,
and it was all that they could do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>To young Brainard this suspense was
more killing than all the stress through
which he had furiously toiled. No light,
no sign of life, nothing to tell whether or
not death had won in the home stretch!</p>

<p>A rescued seaman, battered and spent,
cried out from where he lay on the sand:</p>

<p>"Matt Martin his name is. The <i>Lucy
B.</i> was the vessel's. Coal to Havana.
Mate washed overboard last night. He's
a good skipper, is Martin; looks like that
youngster in the white shirt there."</p>

<p>"We'll find him at high-water mark in a
day or so," bellowed Fritz Wagenhals.
"My Gott, I wish&mdash;no, the boat is no good
here."</p>

<p>The young man shot his fist seaward.</p>

<p>"I'll try to swim out with a line if you'll
let me."</p>

<p>"No, you don't, you tamn fool Boy!"
the keeper shouted back.</p>

<p>Brainard doubled along the edge of the
beach like a hound baffled by a lost trail.
He was almost beside himself with bitter
anger at the storm that it should have
wrought this cruel climax. It had come
as a tremendous revelation to him that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
could help to win this great fight against
wind and sea. His splendid strength had
some place in the world of deeds after all.
Fierce joy and thanksgiving had thrilled
his every fiber that in this hour he was permitted
to be one of the Tarpon Inlet crew.
Now to be robbed of the life of the captain
of the vessel, to stand like wooden
men and let him die who had stayed by
his ship for duty's sake&mdash;this was more
than profoundly sad, it was maddening.</p>

<p>Blindly scouting a little way up the
beach, Brainard glimpsed a bit of wreckage
rearing shoreward, carried beyond the
other watchers by some freak of the undertow.
It looked like all the other sorry
fragments of the schooner, but a second
glance showed him a white patch gleaming
against the black timber. It might be
the tattered foam, but a wild hope halted
him in his tracks, and he stood staring at
the tumbling mass. The white patch did
not vanish, it seemed to move as if writhing
against its background, and now he
was sure he saw it move. To wait an
instant longer was to see the bit of wreckage
pounded in the surf as by Titan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
sledge-hammers. He tore into the first
line of foam, head down, arms extended.
A few tripping strides, and a wall of
water crashed down upon him, solid and
resistless. Stunned as he was he dove by
instinct, and caught breath beyond the
breaker. The fragment of wreckage to
which something was clinging rode a few
yards beyond him. Again he was flung
down and tossed shoreward, and again he
dove with fast weakening effort, nor
could he see that behind him the other
surfmen were struggling to reach him in
a hard-gripped human chain.</p>

<i>As he rose the jagged timber was hurled straight at him.</i></div></div>


<p class="p2">As he rose, the jagged timber was
hurled straight at him like a projectile.
He tried to dodge it, flinging out an arm
to clutch at something white half wrapped
round it. A broken nail or bolt caught
his clothing, and dragged him headlong.
While he threw his arms about the timber
he felt the rags of his trousers tear loose,
and he shook himself free of the deadly
hold. He was no more than conscious
that something stirred as if alive beneath
his shifting grip. Presently the surfmen
cheered as they hauled ashore the broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
beam from which they had to pry loose
two half-naked, water-logged, but living
men.</p>

<p>Day was breaking when the crew of the
schooner, a full muster roll, were helped
into the station. The weary surfmen gave
their bunks to the rescued, and the black
cook made strong coffee and corned-beef
hash with incredible speed. Brainard fell
on the floor like a dead man. But he
could not sleep, for the night had been too
crowded with racking events. His hurts
and exhaustion were forgotten as the
evening at the Coquina Beach Hotel came
back to him, dimly at first, then focusing
more sharply, as if he were recalling
things far distant in time and place.</p>

<p>Amid this welter of impressions loomed
the fact that magically the means had been
provided for him to go back to his own,
and more than this, to see her whose message
had come as from the dead awakened.
As if in a dream, he fumbled for
his trousers pockets. Then it came to
him that he had been forced to put on
Jim Conklin's oilskin breeches while that
comrade was half dragging him home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
from the wreck. He dully wondered
why, until beneath the oil-skins he found
a waistband and a few sodden rags, all
that was left of his evening clothes.
Pockets were gone, and with them&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Five thousand dollars," he muttered
in dazed, stupid fashion.</p>

<p>Just then a babbling chatter broke from
the nearest cot. Brainard raised his head
and saw a young man, no older than himself,
sitting up and feebly swaying, his
wits awry for the moment because of what
he had suffered. The captain of the lost
schooner wrung his hands and cried, while
the tears were on his bruised face:</p>

<p>"No, no, I tell you, the <i>Lucy B.</i> was not
insured.... I named her after you
and she was a lucky vessel.... Cut
away the rags o' that forestays'l, and we'll
bend on somethin' that 'll hold....
We've got to heave her to, I tell you....
Five thousand dollars clean gone,
all I've got and.... If we can fetch
Tarpon Inlet before we founder, we can
get inside.... The <i>Lucy B.</i> gone
to pieces.... You're a liar....
Why, I just bought out old man Holter's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
share last voyage.... Five thousand
dollars, all in the <i>Lucy B.</i>...
All I've got and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Brainard was moved to pity, then
amazement, that in this fashion he should
be brought face to face with a tragedy so
very like his own. But he glimpsed the
fact, and was ashamed of it, that he would
be stirred to deeper sympathy for the
young skipper if there were no womanish
wailing over his loss. And then, guilty
and remorseful, Brainard realized that his
own heart was full of sullen repining,
bitter discontent with the fate that had
robbed him of his treasure and his hopes,
futile outcry against his forced return to
the life of the station. He, then, was
wholly lacking in that very fortitude
which he wished to see displayed by this
broken, fevered sailor in the cot, whose
misfortune was, by far, the more crushing.</p>

<p>Brainard crawled stiffly outside to be
alone. For some time he painfully overhauled
his surging thoughts, and slowly
there faded from his tired young face the
clouding trouble that he had seen mir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>rored
in the face of the boyish captain.
Then he said aloud as if it were a verdict:</p>

<p>"A man who can't take his medicine is a
pretty tough spectacle, isn't he? And it
was all a dream, yes, all a dream&mdash;of
money I didn't earn, and&mdash;and of a girl
I can't marry."</p>

<p>He looked through the doorway, saw
Jim Conklin slip over to the captain's cot
and stroke the hot forehead, and heard
him say:</p>

<p>"I know what it is, old man. I've been
there myself."</p>

<p>The touch of Conklin's hand seemed to
bring the skipper to himself. His slackened
mouth closed with the snap of a steel
trap, and into his face came the alert and
aggressive look of an unbeaten man. He
smiled up at Conklin and said weakly:</p>

<p>"I must have been a little upset in my
top story. Was I talkin' foolishness?
Thank God, we're still alive an' kickin'
strong. I'm all right. How are my men?
No use crying over spilt milk, is there,
shipmate? How's the kid that yanked
me ashore?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Brainard went to his side, repeating as
if he were thinking aloud:</p>

<p>"There's no use crying over spilt milk.
I dreamed I lost five thousand dollars last
night."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be jiggered, so did I,"
cheerfully responded the skipper. "But
it wasn't no dream for me. It won't make
a bit of difference a hundred years from
now, will it? Vessel a total loss, but I'm
no total loss, not for a minute. You fished
me out, and thanks for a neat job, for I'm
pretty fond of just livin'."</p>

<p>Brainard gripped the outstretched
hand, and the two young men smiled into
each other's eyes. Ashley Brainard was
glad that he had found a man, but gladder
was he that he had found himself. For in
that moment the life-saver routed all his
regrets, as he turned to Jim Conklin, with
vibrant earnestness and shining face:</p>

<p>"I'm mighty glad of the chance to stay
here for a while among you men. For
I'm pretty fond of just living, Jim, even
if my dreams can't all come true."</p>

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
